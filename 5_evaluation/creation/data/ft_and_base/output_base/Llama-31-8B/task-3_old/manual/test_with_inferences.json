Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd.

How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try.

I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool!

It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try.

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed.

I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

But you guys should definitely watch it soon!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:54 - Peter: I heard the next season is coming out next year. Is that right?\r\n01.09.2021 13:25:53 - Richard: Yes, that's correct! Can't wait for it!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:00 - Karen: Gosh, I need to hurry up then. So much to watch, so little time!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:33 - Ashley: Tell me about it, Karen. The list just keeps getting longer!\r\n01.09.2021 13:28:50 - John: Maybe we should have a movie night and watch it together?\r\n01.09.2021 13:29:36 - Peter: That's a great idea, John!\r\n01.09.2021 13:30:32 - Richard: I'm in!\r\n01.09.2021 13:31:19 - Karen: Me too!\r\n01.09.2021 13:33:09 - Ashley: Count me in!

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Where are you planning to go?\r\n15.10.2022 05:28:06 - Clara: I'm not sure yet, I was thinking about going to Europe. Have you ever been?\r\n15.10.2022 05:29:51 - Carlton: Yes, I've been to France and Italy. Both were great experiences. \r\n15.10.2022 05:30:42 - Clara: I've always wanted to go to France. What was your favorite part?\r\n15.10.2022 05:31:22 - Carlton: The food was incredible! And the art museums in Paris were a highlight.\r\n15.10.2022 05:32:54 - Clara: That sounds amazing. I think I'll start planning my trip to France!\r\n15.10.2022 05:33:59 - Carlton: That's exciting! Make sure to visit the Louvre and take a trip to the countryside.\r\n15.10.2022 05:34:57 - Clara: Definitely, I'll add those to my list. Thanks for the advice, Carlton.\r\n15.10.2022 05:35:54 - Carlton: No problem, Clara. Have a fantastic trip!\r\n15.10.2022 08:20:19 - Clara: Hey Carlton, have you read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' yet?\r\n15.10.2022 08:21:23 - Carlton: Hey Clara! Yes, I finished it last night. It was an incredibly moving read.\r\n15.10.2022 08:23:11 - Clara: I'm glad you enjoyed it. What did you think of Scout as a character?\r\n15.10.2022 08:23:43 - Carlton: I thought Scout was a brilliant character. She provided an innocent and unique perspective to the racial tension in the story.\r\n15.10.2022 08:25:32 - Clara: Exactly! Her innocence made the events even more poignant. Now, what about '1984'? Have you started that?\r\n15.10.2022 08:26:04 - Carlton: Not yet, but it's next on my list. I've heard it's quite a thought-provoking book.\r\n15.10.2022 08:27:04 - Clara: It certainly is. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it. Happy reading!\r\n15.10.2022 08:27:52 - Carlton: Thanks, Clara! I'll let you know once I've finished it.\r\n15.10.2022 12:26:21 - Clara: Hey Carlton, have you heard the new album from The Weeknd?\r\n15.10.2022 12:28:09 - Carlton: Yes, Clara. I just finished listening to it. It's pretty amazing, don't you think?\r\n15.10.2022 12:29:46 - Clara: Absolutely! I especially loved the track \"Save Your Tears\". The lyrics are so deep.\r\n15.10.2022 12:31:22 - Carlton: I couldn't agree more. But I'm also really into \"Blinding Lights\". The beat is so catchy.\r\n15.10.2022 12:32:48 - Clara: True that. I've been playing it on repeat. What do you think about the overall theme of the album?\r\n15.10.2022 12:33:47 - Carlton: It seems to me that it's about heartbreak and recovery, with a touch of his usual dark style.\r\n15.10.2022 12:35:18 - Clara: Yes, I also think it's a bit darker than his previous work. But I like it, it's different.\r\n15.10.2022 12:36:09 - Carlton: Definitely. It's always refreshing when artists try something new and it works.\r\n15.10.2022 12:37:12 - Clara: Right. By the way, do you have any other music recommendations?\r\n15.10.2022 12:38:48 - Carlton: If you're into The Weeknd, you might also like Frank Ocean. His music has a similar vibe.\r\n15.10.2022 12:40:10 - Clara: Thanks, Carlton! I'll check him out.\r\n15.10.2022 12:42:10 - Carlton: No problem, Clara.

They've just recently collected a sample from the Martian surface.\r\n15.10.2022 14:24:36 - Clara: Yeah, I read about it. It's such a milestone in space exploration, isn't it?\r\n15.10.2022 14:25:10 - Carlton: Definitely. It's mind-blowing to think that we're now able to collect samples from another planet.\r\n15.10.2022 14:26:38 - Clara: I know, right? And the fact that we might discover signs of past microbial life on Mars!\r\n15.10.2022 14:28:25 - Carlton: It's a huge leap towards answering the age-old question: Are we alone in the universe?\r\n15.10.2022 14:29:02 - Clara: Exactly! It's both exciting and a bit scary at the same time.\r\n15.10.2022 14:30:58 - Carlton: I agree. But it's definitely more exciting. The universe is full of possibilities.\r\n15.10.2022 14:32:17 - Clara: I can't wait to see what they'll discover next.\r\n15.10.2022 14:32:55 - Carlton: Me too. These are exciting times we're living in.\r\n15.10.2022 14:34:54 - Clara: Definitely. Let's keep each other posted on any new updates!\r\n15.10.2022 14:36:25 - Carlton: Deal. It's always fun discussing these things with you, Clara.\r\n15.10.2022 17:17:06 - Clara: Hey Carlton, how are you?\r\n15.10.2022 17:18:11 - Carlton: Hey Clara, I'm doing well. Just a bit stressed about exams.\r\n15.10.2022 17:20:02 - Clara: I can relate, these end of year exams are really nerve-wracking.\r\n15.10.2022 17:20:59 - Carlton: Yeah, especially the physics exam. I am really struggling with that subject.\r\n15.10.2022 17:21:32 - Clara: Have you tried revising with some online resources? There are some good YouTube channels that explain the concepts really well.\r\n15.10.2022 17:22:56 - Carlton: I haven't tried that yet. Could you recommend some channels?\r\n15.10.2022 17:23:39 - Clara: Sure, I'll send you some links. Also, we could study together if you want.\r\n15.10.2022 17:24:46 - Carlton: That would be great. Thanks a lot, Clara.\r\n15.10.2022 17:25:43 - Clara: No problem, Carlton. We can get through this together.\r\n15.10.2022 17:26:55 - Carlton: I appreciate it, Clara. You're a lifesaver.\r\n15.10.2022 18:45:30 - Clara: Hey Carlton, got a minute to discuss our next move?\r\n15.10.2022 18:46:29 - Carlton: Sure, Clara. What's on your mind?\r\n15.10.2022 18:47:42 - Clara: I've been thinking about the museum heist. We need to plan carefully.\r\n15.10.2022 18:48:40 - Carlton: Agreed. Let's start with the security. Any idea what we're dealing with?\r\n15.10.2022 18:49:11 - Clara: They have motion detectors and laser security grids. But, I have a contact who can help us disable it.\r\n15.10.2022 18:50:09 - Carlton: Sounds promising. What about the guards and surveillance cameras?\r\n15.10.2022 18:51:53 - Clara: There are four guards on rotation and cameras at every corner. We might need a distraction.\r\n15.10.2022 18:53:40 - Carlton: I might know just the guy for that. Can we trust your contact though?\r\n15.10.2022 18:54:27 - Clara: Absolutely. She's a pro. But we need to act fast, they're switching security companies soon.\r\n15.10.2022 18:55:01 - Carlton: Alright, let's get everyone together tomorrow and lay out the plan.\r\n15.10.2022 18:56:40 - Clara: Sounds like a plan, Carlton. See you tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2022 21:12:12 - Clara: Hey Carlton, have you started watching the new season of 'Stranger Things' yet?\r\n15.10.2022 21:13:45 - Carlton: Not yet, Clara. I've been busy with work. Is it any good?\r\n15.10.2022 21:15:15 - Clara: I think it's amazing! The plot seems more intense this time. You should really start watching it.\r\n15.10.2022 21:16:04 - Carlton: I've heard mixed reviews about it. Some say it's not as good as the previous seasons.\r\n15.10.2022 21:17:57 - Clara: Well, I think it's subjective. I personally loved it. There are some unexpected twists that make it more interesting.\r\n15.10.2022 21:19:46 - Carlton: Alright, you've convinced me. I'll start watching it this weekend.\r\n15.10.2022 21:20:35 - Clara: Great! We can discuss the episodes once you've seen them.\r\n15.10.2022 21:22:35 - Carlton: Sounds good.

What's on your mind?\r\n15.10.2022 18:47:42 - Clara: I've been thinking about the museum heist. We need to plan carefully.\r\n15.10.2022 18:48:40 - Carlton: Agreed. Let's start with the security. Any idea what we're dealing with?\r\n15.10.2022 18:49:11 - Clara: They have motion detectors and laser security grids. But, I have a contact who can help us disable it.\r\n15.10.2022 18:50:09 - Carlton: Sounds promising. What about the guards and surveillance cameras?\r\n15.10.2022 18:51:53 - Clara: There are four guards on rotation and cameras at every corner. We might need a distraction.\r\n15.10.2022 18:53:40 - Carlton: I might know just the guy for that. Can we trust your contact though?\r\n15.10.2022 18:54:27 - Clara: Absolutely. She's a pro. But we need to act fast, they're switching security companies soon.\r\n15.10.2022 18:55:01 - Carlton: Alright, let's get everyone together tomorrow and lay out the plan.\r\n15.10.2022 18:56:40 - Clara: Sounds like a plan, Carlton. See you tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2022 21:12:12 - Clara: Hey Carlton, have you started watching the new season of 'Stranger Things' yet?\r\n15.10.2022 21:13:45 - Carlton: Not yet, Clara. I've been busy with work. Is it any good?\r\n15.10.2022 21:15:15 - Clara: I think it's amazing! The plot seems more intense this time. You should really start watching it.\r\n15.10.2022 21:16:04 - Carlton: I've heard mixed reviews about it. Some say it's not as good as the previous seasons.\r\n15.10.2022 21:17:57 - Clara: Well, I think it's subjective. I personally loved it. There are some unexpected twists that make it more interesting.\r\n15.10.2022 21:19:46 - Carlton: Alright, you've convinced me. I'll start watching it this weekend.\r\n15.10.2022 21:20:35 - Clara: Great! We can discuss the episodes once you've seen them.\r\n15.10.2022 21:22:35 - Carlton: Sounds good.

Have you ever been?\r\n15.10.2022 05:29:51 - Carlton: Yes, I've been to France and Italy. Both were great experiences. \r\n15.10.2022 05:30:42 - Clara: I've always wanted to go to France. What was your favorite part?\r\n15.10.2022 05:31:22 - Carlton: The food was incredible! And the art museums in Paris were a highlight.\r\n15.10.2022 05:32:54 - Clara: That sounds amazing.

It was an incredibly moving read.\r\n15.10.2022 08:23:11 - Clara: I'm glad you enjoyed it. What did you think of Scout as a character?\r\n15.10.2022 08:23:43 - Carlton: I thought Scout was a brilliant character. She provided an innocent and unique perspective to the racial tension in the story.\r\n15.10.2022 08:25:32 - Clara: Exactly! Her innocence made the events even more poignant. Now, what about '1984'? Have you started that?\r\n15.10.2022 08:26:04 - Carlton: Not yet, but it's next on my list. I've heard it's quite a thought-provoking book.\r\n15.10.2022 08:27:04 - Clara: It certainly is.

I just finished listening to it. It's pretty amazing, don't you think?\r\n15.10.2022 12:29:46 - Clara: Absolutely! I especially loved the track \"Save Your Tears\". The lyrics are so deep.\r\n15.10.2022 12:31:22 - Carlton: I couldn't agree more. But I'm also really into \"Blinding Lights\". The beat is so catchy.\r\n15.10.2022 12:32:48 - Clara: True that. I've been playing it on repeat. What do you think about the overall theme of the album?\r\n15.10.2022 12:33:47 - Carlton: It seems to me that it's about heartbreak and recovery, with a touch of his usual dark style.\r\n15.10.2022 12:35:18 - Clara: Yes, I also think it's a bit darker than his previous work. But I like it, it's different.\r\n15.10.2022 12:36:09 - Carlton: Definitely. It's always refreshing when artists try something new and it works.\r\n15.10.2022 12:37:12 - Clara: Right. By the way, do you have any other music recommendations?\r\n15.10.2022 12:38:48 - Carlton: If you're into The Weeknd, you might also like Frank Ocean.

They've just recently collected a sample from the Martian surface.\r\n15.10.2022 14:24:36 - Clara: Yeah, I read about it. It's such a milestone in space exploration, isn't it?\r\n15.10.2022 14:25:10 - Carlton: Definitely. It's mind-blowing to think that we're now able to collect samples from another planet.\r\n15.10.2022 14:26:38 - Clara: I know, right? And the fact that we might discover signs of past microbial life on Mars!\r\n15.10.2022 14:28:25 - Carlton: It's a huge leap towards answering the age-old question: Are we alone in the universe?\r\n15.10.2022 14:29:02 - Clara: Exactly! It's both exciting and a bit scary at the same time.\r\n15.10.2022 14:30:58 - Carlton: I agree. But it's definitely more exciting. The universe is full of possibilities.\r\n15.10.2022 14:32:17 - Clara: I can't wait to see what they'll discover next.\r\n15.10.2022 14:32:55 - Carlton: Me too.

Just a bit stressed about exams.\r\n15.10.2022 17:20:02 - Clara: I can relate, these end of year exams are really nerve-wracking.\r\n15.10.2022 17:20:59 - Carlton: Yeah, especially the physics exam. I am really struggling with that subject.\r\n15.10.2022 17:21:32 - Clara: Have you tried revising with some online resources? There are some good YouTube channels that explain the concepts really well.\r\n15.10.2022 17:22:56 - Carlton: I haven't tried that yet.

The situation is becoming more critical.\r\n20.09.2022 12:25:32 - Ronnie: I agree, Nadir. It's alarming how rapidly the Arctic ice is melting.\r\n20.09.2022 12:26:41 - Sheree: Not just the Arctic, even our local weather patterns have been so unpredictable lately.\r\n20.09.2022 12:28:41 - Robert: True Sheree, it's high time we start taking some serious action.\r\n20.09.2022 12:30:38 - Reba: I was thinking the same. Maybe we should start by minimizing our carbon footprint.\r\n20.09.2022 12:31:17 - Nadir: That's a good start, Reba. We should also encourage others to do the same.\r\n20.09.2022 12:31:58 - Ronnie: Agreed. Also, awareness about the situation is crucial. Many people are still unaware of the gravity of the situation.\r\n20.09.2022 12:33:19 - Sheree: That's right Ronnie. More awareness campaigns are needed.\r\n20.09.2022 12:35:13 - Robert: Let's each do our part and hope for the best.\r\n20.09.2022 16:30:57 - Reba: Hey guys, I've been thinking about our next group adventure. Any thoughts?\r\n20.09.2022 16:32:33 - Nadir: Great idea, Reba! I think we should visit somewhere exotic.\r\n20.09.2022 16:34:12 - Ronnie: What about a safari trip to Africa? I've heard it's a unique experience.\r\n20.09.2022 16:35:09 - Sheree: That sounds awesome, Ronnie. But we also need to consider the budget.\r\n20.09.2022 16:36:37 - Robert: How about backpacking across Europe? It's affordable and we can explore different cultures.\r\n20.09.2022 16:37:54 - Reba: I love the idea, Robert! We could start from Spain and make our way to Greece.\r\n20.09.2022 16:39:13 - Nadir: Sounds like a plan! We should make a list of must-visit places and things to do.\r\n20.09.2022 16:40:53 - Ronnie: Absolutely, Nadir. Also, we need to check the best time to visit these countries.\r\n20.09.2022 16:42:48 - Sheree: Yes, and let's not forget about food. We must try local cuisines in each country.\r\n20.09.2022 16:44:24 - Robert: Agreed, Sheree. I can't wait to try some authentic pizza in Italy.\r\n20.09.2022 16:45:46 - Reba: Sounds like we have a plan, guys. Let's start preparing for our European adventure.\r\n20.09.2022 18:30:00 - Reba: Alright team, we have a new job. The target is the National Museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:31:29 - Nadir: Sounds risky, Reba. What's the prize?\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:28 - Reba: A priceless artifact, The Heart of the Ocean. It's worth the risk.\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:58 - Ronnie: I'm in. I can handle the security systems.\r\n20.09.2022 18:35:48 - Sheree: I'll get us the blueprints of the museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:37:15 - Robert: And I can arrange our getaway vehicle.\r\n20.09.2022 18:38:21 - Reba: Excellent. Everyone knows their role. Let's meet at the usual spot tomorrow to iron out the details.\r\n20.09.2022 18:39:48 - Nadir: I've got a feeling this is going to be a big one.\r\n20.09.2022 18:40:54 - Ronnie: Just another day at the office, Nadir.\r\n20.09.2022 18:41:48 - Sheree: Blueprints are in hand. This place is a maze.\r\n20.09.2022 18:42:49 - Robert: Got us a van. Plain, inconspicuous, just how we like it.\r\n20.09.2022 18:43:27 - Reba: Great work, team.

The situation is becoming more critical.\r\n20.09.2022 12:25:32 - Ronnie: I agree, Nadir. It's alarming how rapidly the Arctic ice is melting.\r\n20.09.2022 12:26:41 - Sheree: Not just the Arctic, even our local weather patterns have been so unpredictable lately.\r\n20.09.2022 12:28:41 - Robert: True Sheree, it's high time we start taking some serious action.\r\n20.09.2022 12:30:38 - Reba: I was thinking the same. Maybe we should start by minimizing our carbon footprint.\r\n20.09.2022 12:31:17 - Nadir: That's a good start, Reba. We should also encourage others to do the same.\r\n20.09.2022 12:31:58 - Ronnie: Agreed. Also, awareness about the situation is crucial.

Any thoughts?\r\n20.09.2022 16:32:33 - Nadir: Great idea, Reba! I think we should visit somewhere exotic.\r\n20.09.2022 16:34:12 - Ronnie: What about a safari trip to Africa? I've heard it's a unique experience.\r\n20.09.2022 16:35:09 - Sheree: That sounds awesome, Ronnie. But we also need to consider the budget.\r\n20.09.2022 16:36:37 - Robert: How about backpacking across Europe? It's affordable and we can explore different cultures.\r\n20.09.2022 16:37:54 - Reba: I love the idea, Robert! We could start from Spain and make our way to Greece.\r\n20.09.2022 16:39:13 - Nadir: Sounds like a plan! We should make a list of must-visit places and things to do.\r\n20.09.2022 16:40:53 - Ronnie: Absolutely, Nadir. Also, we need to check the best time to visit these countries.\r\n20.09.2022 16:42:48 - Sheree: Yes, and let's not forget about food. We must try local cuisines in each country.\r\n20.09.2022 16:44:24 - Robert: Agreed, Sheree. I can't wait to try some authentic pizza in Italy.\r\n20.09.2022 16:45:46 - Reba: Sounds like we have a plan, guys.

It's worth the risk.\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:58 - Ronnie: I'm in. I can handle the security systems.\r\n20.09.2022 18:35:48 - Sheree: I'll get us the blueprints of the museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:37:15 - Robert: And I can arrange our getaway vehicle.\r\n20.09.2022 18:38:21 - Reba: Excellent.

We could start from Spain and make our way to Greece.\r\n20.09.2022 16:39:13 - Nadir: Sounds like a plan! We should make a list of must-visit places and things to do.\r\n20.09.2022 16:40:53 - Ronnie: Absolutely, Nadir. Also, we need to check the best time to visit these countries.\r\n20.09.2022 16:42:48 - Sheree: Yes, and let's not forget about food. We must try local cuisines in each country.\r\n20.09.2022 16:44:24 - Robert: Agreed, Sheree. I can't wait to try some authentic pizza in Italy.\r\n20.09.2022 16:45:46 - Reba: Sounds like we have a plan, guys. Let's start preparing for our European adventure.\r\n20.09.2022 18:30:00 - Reba: Alright team, we have a new job. The target is the National Museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:31:29 - Nadir: Sounds risky, Reba. What's the prize?\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:28 - Reba: A priceless artifact, The Heart of the Ocean. It's worth the risk.\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:58 - Ronnie: I'm in. I can handle the security systems.\r\n20.09.2022 18:35:48 - Sheree: I'll get us the blueprints of the museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:37:15 - Robert: And I can arrange our getaway vehicle.\r\n20.09.2022 18:38:21 - Reba: Excellent. Everyone knows their role. Let's meet at the usual spot tomorrow to iron out the details.\r\n20.09.2022 18:39:48 - Nadir: I've got a feeling this is going to be a big one.\r\n20.09.2022 18:40:54 - Ronnie: Just another day at the office, Nadir.\r\n20.09.2022 18:41:48 - Sheree: Blueprints are in hand. This place is a maze.\r\n20.09.2022 18:42:49 - Robert: Got us a van. Plain, inconspicuous, just how we like it.\r\n20.09.2022 18:43:27 - Reba: Great work, team.

Didn't it find something interesting?\r\n10.05.2022 15:06:24 - Joshua: Yeah! It seems to have found new signs of ancient microbial life. It's a huge discovery.\r\n10.05.2022 15:08:15 - Renea: Oh wow, that's amazing. I wonder what this means for the future of space exploration.\r\n10.05.2022 15:09:40 - Joshua: I think it opens up a lot of possibilities.

I can't wait for the next movie.\r\n10.05.2022 16:40:17 - Joshua: Same here. I heard it's coming out next year.\r\n10.05.2022 16:41:40 - Renea: Yes, I also read that. Any other movies you're looking forward to?\r\n10.05.2022 16:42:15 - Joshua: Actually, I'm quite excited about the new James Bond movie. How about you?\r\n10.05.2022 16:43:25 - Renea: Oh, I can't wait to see that one as well. I'm a big fan of the franchise.\r\n10.05.2022 16:45:19 - Joshua: Great! Maybe we can go watch it together.\r\n10.05.2022 16:46:24 - Renea: That sounds like a plan.

Who's performing?\r\n10.05.2022 20:01:53 - Joshua: It's a mix of different genres. The headliners are Imagine Dragons and Post Malone.\r\n10.05.2022 20:03:07 - Renea: That sounds great. I love Post Malone!\r\n10.05.2022 20:03:52 - Joshua: Me too! They also have a couple of local bands that are really good.\r\n10.05.2022 20:05:31 - Renea: I'm intrigued. When is it?\r\n10.05.2022 20:06:18 - Joshua: It's next Saturday. Are you free?\r\n10.05.2022 20:07:43 - Renea: Yeah, I don't have any plans. Where's the concert?\r\n10.05.2022 20:09:17 - Joshua: It's at the city park. They've got a huge stage set up.\r\n10.05.2022 20:09:47 - Renea: That sounds amazing. Do you know how much the tickets are?\r\n10.05.2022 20:11:19 - Joshua: I think they're around $50. Would you like me to get us a pair?\r\n10.05.2022 20:12:08 - Renea: Yes, please. That would be awesome.\r\n10.05.2022 20:13:24 - Joshua: Great, I'll get them today. Looking forward to it!\r\n10.05.2022 20:15:15 - Renea: Me too.

But the homework is quite a lot.\r\n10.05.2022 22:12:44 - Joshua: Yeah, I've heard she's strict. Think we'll have a lot of tests?\r\n10.05.2022 22:14:12 - Renea: I guess so.

Why do you ask?\r\n10.05.2022 13:48:34 - Joshua: Just for fun, how do you think you would go about it if it was a fictional scenario?\r\n10.05.2022 13:50:27 - Renea: Hmm, I'd probably start by studying the security system in depth.\r\n10.05.2022 13:52:01 - Joshua: Right, and how would you bypass the cameras?\r\n10.05.2022 13:52:59 - Renea: Maybe hack into the system and loop the feed?\r\n10.05.2022 13:54:32 - Joshua: Good idea, and what about the laser security?\r\n10.05.2022 13:55:39 - Renea: I'd use smoke or dust to reveal them, then carefully navigate through.\r\n10.05.2022 13:56:48 - Joshua: Lastly, how would you open the vault?\r\n10.05.2022 13:57:48 - Renea: I'd have to figure out the lock mechanism.

Didn't it find something interesting?\r\n10.05.2022 15:06:24 - Joshua: Yeah! It seems to have found new signs of ancient microbial life. It's a huge discovery.\r\n10.05.2022 15:08:15 - Renea: Oh wow, that's amazing. I wonder what this means for the future of space exploration.\r\n10.05.2022 15:09:40 - Joshua: I think it opens up a lot of possibilities. Maybe there was life on Mars in the past.\r\n10.05.2022 15:11:30 - Renea: That's an exciting thought. Do you think there could still be life on Mars now?\r\n10.05.2022 15:12:46 - Joshua: It's hard to say, but I think it's definitely a possibility.

I've always wanted to see the Northern Lights in Iceland. \r\n01.03.2022 16:13:15 - Katherine: That sounds amazing, Desiree! I'd love to go to Japan, the culture and food have always intrigued me.\r\n01.03.2022 16:13:48 - Ronda: Japan sounds great, Katherine. I have always wanted to go on a safari in Kenya though.\r\n01.03.2022 16:15:03 - Mario: I have a soft spot for history. So, Greece is on top of my list. \r\n01.03.2022 16:16:35 - Jason: Great choices everyone! Let's put these options into a poll and vote?\r\n01.03.2022 16:17:12 - Desiree: Good idea Jason. But before that, let's discuss the best time to travel to these places.\r\n01.03.2022 16:18:02 - Katherine: For Japan, it's best to go in Spring for the cherry blossoms, or in Autumn for the fall colors.\r\n01.03.2022 16:19:57 - Ronda: In Kenya, the best wildlife viewing months are during the dry season from late June to October.\r\n01.03.2022 16:21:16 - Mario: And for Greece, the best time is from April to early November. The weather is warm and there's little rain.\r\n01.03.2022 16:22:39 - Desiree: For Iceland, the best time to see the Northern Lights is from late September to late March.\r\n01.03.2022 16:23:37 - Jason: Perfect, let's put all this info into the poll too.\r\n01.03.2022 16:24:30 - Katherine: Great! Looking forward to this trip, wherever we end up going!\r\n01.03.2022 16:26:06 - Ronda: Same here, can't wait!\r\n01.03.2022 19:30:00 - Jason: Hey team, I've been thinking about our next target. What do you all think about the old mansion on Main Street?\r\n01.03.2022 19:31:39 - Desiree: Sounds promising, Jason. But isn't it rumored to be haunted?\r\n01.03.2022 19:33:34 - Katherine: That's just a myth, Desiree. I think it could be a good idea. We need to plan carefully though.\r\n01.03.2022 19:34:20 - Ronda: I agree with Katherine. We need to ensure we have all exit points covered.\r\n01.03.2022 19:35:05 - Mario: I can handle the security systems. But we need someone on the lookout too.\r\n01.03.2022 19:37:02 - Jason: Good point, Mario. Desiree, could you handle that?\r\n01.03.2022 19:38:54 - Desiree: Sure, Jason. I'll keep an eye out for any unexpected surprises.\r\n01.03.2022 19:40:11 - Katherine: Let's meet tomorrow to discuss the plan in detail.\r\n01.03.2022 19:41:28 - Ronda: Works for me. Let's keep everything low-key as usual.\r\n01.03.2022 19:43:19 - Mario: Agreed. See you all tomorrow.\r\n01.03.2022 21:19:42 - Jason: Hey guys, I just finished reading 'The Alchemist'. Absolutely loved it!\r\n01.03.2022 21:20:24 - Desiree: Oh, I love Paulo Coelho's work! Have you read 'Brida' yet, Jason?\r\n01.03.2022 21:22:07 - Katherine: I have heard a lot about 'The Alchemist', but never got around to reading it. What's it about, Jason?\r\n01.03.2022 21:24:05 - Jason: It's about a young shepherd named Santiago who embarks on a journey to find a worldly treasure. But, along the way, he discovers himself.\r\n01.03.2022 21:25:22 - Ronda: Sounds interesting. I might give it a read.\r\n01.03.2022 21:26:34 - Mario: I prefer non-fiction. Currently reading 'Sapiens' by Yuval Noah Harari. It's mind-blowing!\r\n01.03.2022 21:27:33 - Desiree: I've heard great things about 'Sapiens', Mario. What's it about?\r\n01.03.2022 21:28:08 - Mario: It's about the history of humankind, right from the evolution of Homo Sapiens to the present day. It presents some thought-provoking perspectives.\r\n01.03.2022 21:29:48 - Katherine: Wow, that sounds intriguing, Mario. I'll add it to my reading list.\r\n01.03.2022 21:31:13 - Ronda: I'm into mystery novels. Just started with 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.\r\n01.03.2022 21:32:54 - Jason: That's a great book, Ronda. You're in for a treat!\r\n01.03.2022 21:34:22 - Desiree: I'll have to check that out too. So many books, so little time!\r\n01.03.2022 21:35:51 - Katherine: Tell me about it, Desiree. My reading list keeps growing!\r\n01.03.2022 21:37:25 - Jason: Haha, same here. Well, happy reading everyone!\r\n01.03.2022 22:25:26 - Jason: So what do you guys think about existentialism?\r\n01.03.2022 22:27:12 - Desiree: Well, I find it quite intriguing. It's all about finding self and personal meaning in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:28:26 - Katherine: I agree with Desiree, but it also feels like a lonely philosophy. It relies so heavily on the individual.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:08 - Ronda: But isn't that the point, Katherine? To highlight the importance of individual choice in a seemingly indifferent universe.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:42 - Mario: I see your points, but I lean more towards Absurdism. Life is meaningless and it's up to us to create our own purpose.\r\n01.03.2022 22:32:00 - Jason: That's interesting, Mario. But doesn't that sound similar to Existentialism?\r\n01.03.2022 22:32:47 - Mario: They're similar, but Absurdism is more about embracing the absurdity of life rather than seeking personal meaning.\r\n01.03.2022 22:33:23 - Katherine: I can see why you'd think that way, Mario. It's definitely a unique perspective.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:12 - Desiree: Regardless of our philosophical inclinations, I think it's beautiful how we can interpret and find our own meanings in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:58 - Ronda: Absolutely, Desiree. That's the beauty of philosophy, isn't it? It allows us to explore different perspectives and possibilities.\r\n01.03.2022 22:37:08 - Jason: Well said, everyone. This was a great discussion.\r\n02.03.2022 03:28:34 - Jason: Hey guys, have you heard the new Coldplay album?\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:08 - Desiree: Yes, I actually have. I think it's one of their best works yet.\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:57 - Katherine: I haven't listened to it yet. Is it really that good?\r\n02.03.2022 03:31:31 - Ronda: I'm not much of a Coldplay fan, but I'll give it a listen.\r\n02.03.2022 03:33:14 - Mario: I'm with Ronda. Not a fan, but I won't knock it until I try it.\r\n02.03.2022 03:34:29 - Jason: That's the spirit, guys! Let's all give it a listen and discuss it next time.\r\n02.03.2022 03:35:47 - Desiree: Sounds like a plan. Music discussion night, here we come!\r\n02.03.2022 03:37:02 - Katherine: I'm in! I'll listen to it tonight.\r\n02.03.2022 03:37:59 - Ronda: Same here. It'll be a new experience for sure.\r\n02.03.2022 03:39:52 - Mario: Count me in as well.

But before that, let's discuss the best time to travel to these places.\r\n01.03.2022 16:18:02 - Katherine: For Japan, it's best to go in Spring for the cherry blossoms, or in Autumn for the fall colors.\r\n01.03.2022 16:19:57 - Ronda: In Kenya, the best wildlife viewing months are during the dry season from late June to October.\r\n01.03.2022 16:21:16 - Mario: And for Greece, the best time is from April to early November. The weather is warm and there's little rain.\r\n01.03.2022 16:22:39 - Desiree: For Iceland, the best time to see the Northern Lights is from late September to late March.\r\n01.03.2022 16:23:37 - Jason: Perfect, let's put all this info into the poll too.\r\n01.03.2022 16:24:30 - Katherine: Great! Looking forward to this trip, wherever we end up going!\r\n01.03.2022 16:26:06 - Ronda: Same here, can't wait!\r\n01.03.2022 19:30:00 - Jason: Hey team, I've been thinking about our next target. What do you all think about the old mansion on Main Street?\r\n01.03.2022 19:31:39 - Desiree: Sounds promising, Jason. But isn't it rumored to be haunted?\r\n01.03.2022 19:33:34 - Katherine: That's just a myth, Desiree. I think it could be a good idea. We need to plan carefully though.\r\n01.03.2022 19:34:20 - Ronda: I agree with Katherine. We need to ensure we have all exit points covered.\r\n01.03.2022 19:35:05 - Mario: I can handle the security systems. But we need someone on the lookout too.\r\n01.03.2022 19:37:02 - Jason: Good point, Mario. Desiree, could you handle that?\r\n01.03.2022 19:38:54 - Desiree: Sure, Jason. I'll keep an eye out for any unexpected surprises.\r\n01.03.2022 19:40:11 - Katherine: Let's meet tomorrow to discuss the plan in detail.\r\n01.03.2022 19:41:28 - Ronda: Works for me. Let's keep everything low-key as usual.\r\n01.03.2022 19:43:19 - Mario: Agreed. See you all tomorrow.\r\n01.03.2022 21:19:42 - Jason: Hey guys, I just finished reading 'The Alchemist'. Absolutely loved it!\r\n01.03.2022 21:20:24 - Desiree: Oh, I love Paulo Coelho's work! Have you read 'Brida' yet, Jason?\r\n01.03.2022 21:22:07 - Katherine: I have heard a lot about 'The Alchemist', but never got around to reading it. What's it about, Jason?\r\n01.03.2022 21:24:05 - Jason: It's about a young shepherd named Santiago who embarks on a journey to find a worldly treasure. But, along the way, he discovers himself.\r\n01.03.2022 21:25:22 - Ronda: Sounds interesting. I might give it a read.\r\n01.03.2022 21:26:34 - Mario: I prefer non-fiction. Currently reading 'Sapiens' by Yuval Noah Harari. It's mind-blowing!\r\n01.03.2022 21:27:33 - Desiree: I've heard great things about 'Sapiens', Mario. What's it about?\r\n01.03.2022 21:28:08 - Mario: It's about the history of humankind, right from the evolution of Homo Sapiens to the present day. It presents some thought-provoking perspectives.\r\n01.03.2022 21:29:48 - Katherine: Wow, that sounds intriguing, Mario. I'll add it to my reading list.\r\n01.03.2022 21:31:13 - Ronda: I'm into mystery novels. Just started with 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.\r\n01.03.2022 21:32:54 - Jason: That's a great book, Ronda. You're in for a treat!\r\n01.03.2022 21:34:22 - Desiree: I'll have to check that out too. So many books, so little time!\r\n01.03.2022 21:35:51 - Katherine: Tell me about it, Desiree. My reading list keeps growing!\r\n01.03.2022 21:37:25 - Jason: Haha, same here. Well, happy reading everyone!\r\n01.03.2022 22:25:26 - Jason: So what do you guys think about existentialism?\r\n01.03.2022 22:27:12 - Desiree: Well, I find it quite intriguing. It's all about finding self and personal meaning in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:28:26 - Katherine: I agree with Desiree, but it also feels like a lonely philosophy. It relies so heavily on the individual.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:08 - Ronda: But isn't that the point, Katherine? To highlight the importance of individual choice in a seemingly indifferent universe.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:42 - Mario: I see your points, but I lean more towards Absurdism. Life is meaningless and it's up to us to create our own purpose.\r\n01.03.2022 22:32:00 - Jason: That's interesting, Mario. But doesn't that sound similar to Existentialism?\r\n01.03.2022 22:32:47 - Mario: They're similar, but Absurdism is more about embracing the absurdity of life rather than seeking personal meaning.\r\n01.03.2022 22:33:23 - Katherine: I can see why you'd think that way, Mario. It's definitely a unique perspective.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:12 - Desiree: Regardless of our philosophical inclinations, I think it's beautiful how we can interpret and find our own meanings in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:58 - Ronda: Absolutely, Desiree. That's the beauty of philosophy, isn't it? It allows us to explore different perspectives and possibilities.\r\n01.03.2022 22:37:08 - Jason: Well said, everyone. This was a great discussion.\r\n02.03.2022 03:28:34 - Jason: Hey guys, have you heard the new Coldplay album?\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:08 - Desiree: Yes, I actually have. I think it's one of their best works yet.\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:57 - Katherine: I haven't listened to it yet. Is it really that good?\r\n02.03.2022 03:31:31 - Ronda: I'm not much of a Coldplay fan, but I'll give it a listen.\r\n02.03.2022 03:33:14 - Mario: I'm with Ronda. Not a fan, but I won't knock it until I try it.\r\n02.03.2022 03:34:29 - Jason: That's the spirit, guys! Let's all give it a listen and discuss it next time.\r\n02.03.2022 03:35:47 - Desiree: Sounds like a plan. Music discussion night, here we come!\r\n02.03.2022 03:37:02 - Katherine: I'm in! I'll listen to it tonight.\r\n02.03.2022 03:37:59 - Ronda: Same here. It'll be a new experience for sure.\r\n02.03.2022 03:39:52 - Mario: Count me in as well.

Well, happy reading everyone!\r\n01.03.2022 22:25:26 - Jason: So what do you guys think about existentialism?\r\n01.03.2022 22:27:12 - Desiree: Well, I find it quite intriguing. It's all about finding self and personal meaning in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:28:26 - Katherine: I agree with Desiree, but it also feels like a lonely philosophy. It relies so heavily on the individual.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:08 - Ronda: But isn't that the point, Katherine? To highlight the importance of individual choice in a seemingly indifferent universe.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:42 - Mario: I see your points, but I lean more towards Absurdism. Life is meaningless and it's up to us to create our own purpose.\r\n01.03.2022 22:32:00 - Jason: That's interesting, Mario. But doesn't that sound similar to Existentialism?\r\n01.03.2022 22:32:47 - Mario: They're similar, but Absurdism is more about embracing the absurdity of life rather than seeking personal meaning.\r\n01.03.2022 22:33:23 - Katherine: I can see why you'd think that way, Mario. It's definitely a unique perspective.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:12 - Desiree: Regardless of our philosophical inclinations, I think it's beautiful how we can interpret and find our own meanings in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:58 - Ronda: Absolutely, Desiree. That's the beauty of philosophy, isn't it? It allows us to explore different perspectives and possibilities.\r\n01.03.2022 22:37:08 - Jason: Well said, everyone. This was a great discussion.\r\n02.03.2022 03:28:34 - Jason: Hey guys, have you heard the new Coldplay album?\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:08 - Desiree: Yes, I actually have. I think it's one of their best works yet.\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:57 - Katherine: I haven't listened to it yet. Is it really that good?\r\n02.03.2022 03:31:31 - Ronda: I'm not much of a Coldplay fan, but I'll give it a listen.\r\n02.03.2022 03:33:14 - Mario: I'm with Ronda. Not a fan, but I won't knock it until I try it.\r\n02.03.2022 03:34:29 - Jason: That's the spirit, guys! Let's all give it a listen and discuss it next time.\r\n02.03.2022 03:35:47 - Desiree: Sounds like a plan. Music discussion night, here we come!\r\n02.03.2022 03:37:02 - Katherine: I'm in! I'll listen to it tonight.\r\n02.03.2022 03:37:59 - Ronda: Same here. It'll be a new experience for sure.\r\n02.03.2022 03:39:52 - Mario: Count me in as well. Let's see if it changes my mind about Coldplay.\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

It's a bit complex.\r\n28.08.2024 01:38:12 - Azaiah: I understand. Let's break it down together. We can start by identifying the main goals the client wants to achieve.\r\n28.08.2024 01:39:59 - Eusebia: That sounds like a good idea. The main goal, as I understand it, is to revamp their existing website and make it more user-friendly.\r\n28.08.2024 01:41:04 - Azaiah: That's a great start. Now, we need to figure out what 'user-friendly' means to them.

When is the concert?\r\n28.08.2024 05:48:48 - Eusebia: It's on the 25th of next month.\r\n28.08.2024 05:50:04 - Azaiah: That's perfect. I am free that day.

What seems to be the problem?\r\n28.08.2024 08:18:13 - Eusebia: I have been feeling very tired and weak. I also have frequent headaches.\r\n28.08.2024 08:19:49 - Azaiah: It sounds like you need to see a doctor, Eusebia.

There's a lot of studying, but I'm enjoying my course and the social life.\r\n28.08.2024 13:38:22 - Eusebia: That's great to hear! What's been the most challenging part for you?\r\n28.08.2024 13:40:08 - Azaiah: I think the most challenging part has been managing my time effectively. There's so much to do and so little time.\r\n28.08.2024 13:41:18 - Eusebia: I can definitely relate to that. Do you have any tips on how to handle it?\r\n28.08.2024 13:42:40 - Azaiah: I try to make a schedule every week and stick to it. It helps to keep track of assignments and exams.\r\n28.08.2024 13:43:49 - Eusebia: That's a good strategy. I'll try it out. Thanks, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 13:45:24 - Azaiah: No problem, Eusebia.

How can I assist you today?\r\n28.08.2024 01:34:35 - Eusebia: I wanted to discuss the new project we are working on. I'm struggling a bit with the initial stages.\r\n28.08.2024 01:35:33 - Azaiah: Of course, Eusebia. Can you tell me exactly where you're facing issues?\r\n28.08.2024 01:37:14 - Eusebia: I am having trouble understanding the client's requirement. It's a bit complex.\r\n28.08.2024 01:38:12 - Azaiah: I understand. Let's break it down together. We can start by identifying the main goals the client wants to achieve.\r\n28.08.2024 01:39:59 - Eusebia: That sounds like a good idea. The main goal, as I understand it, is to revamp their existing website and make it more user-friendly.\r\n28.08.2024 01:41:04 - Azaiah: That's a great start. Now, we need to figure out what 'user-friendly' means to them. Have they provided any specifics?\r\n28.08.2024 01:42:19 - Eusebia: Yes, they mentioned they want a simple, clean design with easy navigation.\r\n28.08.2024 01:43:23 - Azaiah: Perfect. Let's start working on a design outline based on this. I'll assist you throughout the process.\r\n28.08.2024 01:45:08 - Eusebia: Thank you, Azaiah. Your guidance is truly appreciated.\r\n28.08.2024 01:46:04 - Azaiah: No problem, Eusebia. We're a team and we're in this together.\r\n28.08.2024 05:43:01 - Eusebia: Hey Azaiah, have you heard about the upcoming concert in town?\r\n28.08.2024 05:44:50 - Azaiah: No, I haven't. Who's performing?\r\n28.08.2024 05:46:08 - Eusebia: It's the rock band, The Rolling Stones.\r\n28.08.2024 05:46:48 - Azaiah: Oh wow, I am a huge fan of them. When is the concert?\r\n28.08.2024 05:48:48 - Eusebia: It's on the 25th of next month.\r\n28.08.2024 05:50:04 - Azaiah: That's perfect. I am free that day. Where can I get the tickets?\r\n28.08.2024 05:51:54 - Eusebia: They are selling them online. I can send you the link.\r\n28.08.2024 05:53:11 - Azaiah: Please do, and thanks for the info!\r\n28.08.2024 05:53:59 - Eusebia: You're welcome. It's going to be a blast!\r\n28.08.2024 05:55:59 - Azaiah: I can't wait. Let's plan to go together.\r\n28.08.2024 05:57:42 - Eusebia: Sounds like a plan. See you at the concert, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 05:58:53 - Azaiah: Definitely, see you there, Eusebia.\r\n28.08.2024 08:15:10 - Eusebia: Hi Azaiah, I have been having some health issues lately.\r\n28.08.2024 08:16:27 - Azaiah: Oh no Eusebia, sorry to hear that. What seems to be the problem?\r\n28.08.2024 08:18:13 - Eusebia: I have been feeling very tired and weak. I also have frequent headaches.\r\n28.08.2024 08:19:49 - Azaiah: It sounds like you need to see a doctor, Eusebia. It could be something simple like a vitamin deficiency, but it's best to get checked.\r\n28.08.2024 08:20:43 - Eusebia: Yes, I agree. I have scheduled an appointment for next week.\r\n28.08.2024 08:22:32 - Azaiah: That's good, Eusebia. In the meantime, try to eat healthily and rest as much as you can.\r\n28.08.2024 08:24:09 - Eusebia: I will. Thank you for your concern, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 08:26:02 - Azaiah: Of course, Eusebia. Health is important. Let me know how it goes, okay?\r\n28.08.2024 08:27:11 - Eusebia: I definitely will. Thanks, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 08:28:56 - Azaiah: You're welcome, Eusebia. Take care.\r\n28.08.2024 13:35:47 - Eusebia: Hey Azaiah, how are you finding your college experience so far?\r\n28.08.2024 13:36:39 - Azaiah: Hi Eusebia, it's been a mix of emotions. There's a lot of studying, but I'm enjoying my course and the social life.\r\n28.08.2024 13:38:22 - Eusebia: That's great to hear! What's been the most challenging part for you?\r\n28.08.2024 13:40:08 - Azaiah: I think the most challenging part has been managing my time effectively. There's so much to do and so little time.\r\n28.08.2024 13:41:18 - Eusebia: I can definitely relate to that. Do you have any tips on how to handle it?\r\n28.08.2024 13:42:40 - Azaiah: I try to make a schedule every week and stick to it. It helps to keep track of assignments and exams.\r\n28.08.2024 13:43:49 - Eusebia: That's a good strategy. I'll try it out. Thanks, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 13:45:24 - Azaiah: No problem, Eusebia.

Last time we almost got caught because of that.\r\n27.08.2024 21:16:54 - Lavern: Already checked, there's no backup this time. But the guard shift change is at 2 AM, so we need to be quick.\r\n27.08.2024 21:18:01 - Ashton: Perfect, then we'll go in right after the shift change. Who's got the gear?\r\n27.08.2024 21:19:42 - Ryan: I\u2019ll bring the tools. Lavern, you\u2019re on lookout, right?\r\n27.08.2024 21:21:17 - Lavern: Yeah, I\u2019ll have the van ready around the corner. Make sure you wear gloves.\r\n27.08.2024 21:22:10 - Linda: Got it. We can\u2019t leave any traces behind. How about the security cameras?\r\n27.08.2024 21:23:59 - Ashton: Ryan\u2019s got that covered. He\u2019ll loop the feed while we\u2019re inside.\r\n27.08.2024 21:24:53 - Ryan: I\u2019ll disable them as soon as we\u2019re ready to move in.

No mistakes this time. Everyone knows their role, let\u2019s stick to it.\r\n27.08.2024 21:27:38 - Ryan: Meet at the usual spot at 1:30 AM. Don\u2019t be late.\r\n27.08.2024 23:06:21 - Ashton: Hi guys, have you picked up any new hobbies during the quarantine?\r\n27.08.2024 23:07:34 - Ryan: I've actually started baking. Never thought I'd enjoy it this much!\r\n27.08.2024 23:08:18 - Linda: That's awesome, Ryan! I've been doing a lot of gardening. It's so therapeutic.\r\n27.08.2024 23:09:12 - Ashton: I've heard a lot about gardening being therapeutic. Maybe I should try it too.\r\n27.08.2024 23:10:01 - Lavern: Well, I've been doing a lot of reading. Anyone has any book suggestions?\r\n27.08.2024 23:11:58 - Ryan: If you're into mystery, I recommend 'The Silent Patient'. It's really gripping.\r\n27.08.2024 23:13:38 - Linda: I'm more into biographies. Recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. Highly recommend it.\r\n27.08.2024 23:14:21 - Ashton: I've been learning guitar. If anyone's interested, I can share some learning resources.\r\n27.08.2024 23:16:19 - Lavern: That'd be great Ashton! I've always wanted to learn a musical instrument.\r\n27.08.2024 23:17:40 - Ryan: Same here. Please share the resources, Ashton.\r\n27.08.2024 23:19:29 - Linda: Looking forward to it Ashton. And Ryan, do share some of your baking recipes!\r\n27.08.2024 23:20:37 - Ashton: Sure thing. Will share the guitar resources soon.\r\n27.08.2024 23:21:09 - Lavern: Thanks Ashton. This chat has been really helpful. Let's do this more often.\r\n28.08.2024 03:10:31 - Ashton: Hey guys, how many siblings do you all have?\r\n28.08.2024 03:11:05 - Ryan: I have two younger brothers and one older sister. You?\r\n28.08.2024 03:12:29 - Linda: Just one younger sister here. \r\n28.08.2024 03:13:57 - Ashton: Interesting, I have one older brother and two younger sisters.\r\n28.08.2024 03:15:35 - Lavern: I'm the only child, so no siblings here.\r\n28.08.2024 03:17:32 - Ryan: Lavern, do you ever wish you had siblings?\r\n28.08.2024 03:18:13 - Lavern: Sometimes, yes. But I also appreciate the perks of being an only child.\r\n28.08.2024 03:18:59 - Linda: I think it's fun to have a sibling. I can't imagine being an only child.\r\n28.08.2024 03:19:56 - Ashton: Agree with you Linda. My siblings and I have a lot of fun together.\r\n28.08.2024 03:20:31 - Ryan: Yeah, siblings can be annoying but they are also your best friends.\r\n28.08.2024 03:22:21 - Linda: So true, Ryan! Despite the fights, I wouldn't trade my sister for anything.\r\n28.08.2024 03:23:45 - Ashton: Same here! I love my siblings to bits, even when they drive me crazy.\r\n28.08.2024 03:24:36 - Lavern: You guys make having siblings sound so fun. Maybe I missed out on something.\r\n28.08.2024 03:25:17 - Ryan: Every family is unique, Lavern. There are pros and cons to every situation.\r\n28.08.2024 03:26:38 - Linda: Well said, Ryan. At the end of the day, it's the love in the family that matters.\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

Maybe I should try it too.\r\n27.08.2024 23:10:01 - Lavern: Well, I've been doing a lot of reading. Anyone has any book suggestions?\r\n27.08.2024 23:11:58 - Ryan: If you're into mystery, I recommend 'The Silent Patient'.

You can visit Rome and Florence for the history and Tuscany for the beautiful countryside.\r\n25.08.2024 16:31:11 - Amanda: That sounds perfect. Do you have any hotel recommendations?\r\n25.08.2024 16:32:38 - Paulette: In Rome, Hotel Hassler is a great option.

Any must-see sights or activities?\r\n25.08.2024 16:35:31 - Paulette: In Rome, the Colosseum and Vatican are must-sees.

I can't wait!\r\n25.08.2024 16:37:00 - Paulette: You're going to have a great time. Don't forget to try the local cuisine!\r\n25.08.2024 16:37:48 - Amanda: I won't!

Is it any good?\r\n26.08.2024 00:43:53 - Amanda: Oh it's brilliant! The portrayal of Princess Diana is just amazing.\r\n26.08.2024 00:45:18 - Paulette: Oh wow, I'll have to check it out then!\r\n26.08.2024 00:46:12 - Amanda: You definitely should. Do you have any show recommendations for me?\r\n26.08.2024 00:47:33 - Paulette: Hmm, have you tried watching The Queen's Gambit? It's not exactly a historical drama, but it's really entertaining.\r\n26.08.2024 00:49:31 - Amanda: No, I haven't. I'll add it to my watch list. Thanks!\r\n26.08.2024 00:50:37 - Paulette: No problem!

Enjoy your movie night, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 05:32:44 - Amanda: Hi Paulette, have you ever pondered about the concept of existence? What it truly means to exist?\r\n26.08.2024 05:34:36 - Paulette: Hello Amanda, that's a deep question. I think existence is subjective. It's different for every individual based on their perception.\r\n26.08.2024 05:35:15 - Amanda: That's an interesting viewpoint. What about the idea of reality? Do you think our reality is constructed by our minds or is it an independent entity?\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:13 - Paulette: I lean towards the concept of constructed reality. Our experiences and perceptions shape our reality.\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:59 - Amanda: So, would you say our thoughts and consciousness shape the reality around us?\r\n26.08.2024 05:38:20 - Paulette: Yes, I believe so. But at the same time, I think there are certain objective truths or realities that exist beyond our perceptions.\r\n26.08.2024 05:39:54 - Amanda: It's fascinating to think about, isn't it? How our minds can potentially shape the world around us.\r\n26.08.2024 05:41:00 - Paulette: Definitely, it's an intriguing subject. Philosophy really makes you question the world and your place in it.\r\n26.08.2024 11:07:10 - Amanda: Hey Paulette, have you tried that new Italian restaurant downtown?\r\n26.08.2024 11:09:07 - Paulette: Hi Amanda, are you talking about Bella Napoli?\r\n26.08.2024 11:10:16 - Amanda: Yes, that's the one! I heard it's really good.\r\n26.08.2024 11:11:02 - Paulette: I've been there once. The pasta was amazing!\r\n26.08.2024 11:12:03 - Amanda: Really? What else did you try?\r\n26.08.2024 11:13:45 - Paulette: I also had the tiramisu. It was absolutely delicious.\r\n26.08.2024 11:14:49 - Amanda: That sounds great. I'm thinking of going there this weekend.\r\n26.08.2024 11:15:27 - Paulette: You should! And make sure to try their seafood risotto. It's their specialty.\r\n26.08.2024 11:17:22 - Amanda: Seafood risotto, got it. Thanks for the recommendation, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 11:18:50 - Paulette: You're welcome, Amanda.

Is it good?\r\n26.08.2024 15:19:11 - Amanda: It's amazing! I love how they've developed the characters.\r\n26.08.2024 15:20:43 - Paulette: That sounds promising. I'll have to catch up soon.\r\n26.08.2024 15:22:33 - Amanda: You should! Oh, and have you seen The Witcher?\r\n26.08.2024 15:23:44 - Paulette: No, I haven't. Is it worth a watch?\r\n26.08.2024 15:25:10 - Amanda: Absolutely! The storyline is so intriguing.\r\n26.08.2024 15:27:05 - Paulette: I'll add that to my list too then. Thanks for the recommendations, Amanda.\r\n26.08.2024 15:27:55 - Amanda: You're welcome, Paulette! Enjoy your TV time.\r\n26.08.2024 15:29:51 - Paulette: Definitely will.

Stay sharp, Amanda.\r\n25.08.2024 14:35:06 - Amanda: Always. See you tomorrow.\r\n25.08.2024 16:23:41 - Amanda: Hi Paulette, I am planning a trip and could use some advice.\r\n25.08.2024 16:25:00 - Paulette: Sure Amanda, I would love to help. Where are you planning to go?\r\n25.08.2024 16:26:12 - Amanda: I was thinking about Europe. Maybe France or Italy.\r\n25.08.2024 16:27:44 - Paulette: Oh, both are great choices! Do you prefer cities or countryside?\r\n25.08.2024 16:28:51 - Amanda: I think a bit of both. I love history, but I also enjoy relaxing in nature.\r\n25.08.2024 16:30:21 - Paulette: Then I would recommend Italy. You can visit Rome and Florence for the history and Tuscany for the beautiful countryside.\r\n25.08.2024 16:31:11 - Amanda: That sounds perfect. Do you have any hotel recommendations?\r\n25.08.2024 16:32:38 - Paulette: In Rome, Hotel Hassler is a great option. In Florence, check out the St. Regis, and in Tuscany, Castello Banfi il Borgo is beautiful.\r\n25.08.2024 16:33:33 - Amanda: Thanks Paulette, I will check them out. Any must-see sights or activities?\r\n25.08.2024 16:35:31 - Paulette: In Rome, the Colosseum and Vatican are must-sees. Florence is famous for its art galleries, and in Tuscany, you can go wine tasting.\r\n25.08.2024 16:36:24 - Amanda: Sounds amazing. I can't wait!\r\n25.08.2024 16:37:00 - Paulette: You're going to have a great time. Don't forget to try the local cuisine!\r\n25.08.2024 16:37:48 - Amanda: I won't! Thanks for all your help, Paulette.\r\n25.08.2024 21:38:25 - Amanda: Hey Paulette, do you have the notes from yesterday's Chemistry class?\r\n25.08.2024 21:40:03 - Paulette: Hi Amanda! Yes, I do. Do you want me to send them over?\r\n25.08.2024 21:41:54 - Amanda: Yes please, that would be great. I missed the class because of basketball practice.\r\n25.08.2024 21:42:51 - Paulette: No problem, I'll send them to you shortly. How's the basketball team doing?\r\n25.08.2024 21:44:41 - Amanda: We're doing good. We've been practicing for the upcoming tournament.\r\n25.08.2024 21:45:22 - Paulette: That sounds exciting! I'll come and cheer for you guys.\r\n25.08.2024 21:47:13 - Amanda: That'd be great, thanks! We could use all the support we can get.\r\n25.08.2024 21:48:45 - Paulette: Of course, we're in this high school journey together after all. I'll send the notes now.\r\n25.08.2024 21:49:36 - Amanda: Thanks, Paulette. You're a lifesaver!\r\n25.08.2024 21:50:13 - Paulette: Anything for a friend. Let's ace this semester together!\r\n26.08.2024 00:40:31 - Amanda: Hey Paulette! Have you watched the latest season of The Crown yet?\r\n26.08.2024 00:42:30 - Paulette: Hi Amanda! No, not yet. Is it any good?\r\n26.08.2024 00:43:53 - Amanda: Oh it's brilliant! The portrayal of Princess Diana is just amazing.\r\n26.08.2024 00:45:18 - Paulette: Oh wow, I'll have to check it out then!\r\n26.08.2024 00:46:12 - Amanda: You definitely should. Do you have any show recommendations for me?\r\n26.08.2024 00:47:33 - Paulette: Hmm, have you tried watching The Queen's Gambit? It's not exactly a historical drama, but it's really entertaining.\r\n26.08.2024 00:49:31 - Amanda: No, I haven't. I'll add it to my watch list. Thanks!\r\n26.08.2024 00:50:37 - Paulette: No problem! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n26.08.2024 00:51:41 - Amanda: Sure thing. By the way, have you heard of the new movie Tenet?\r\n26.08.2024 00:52:33 - Paulette: Yes, I've heard of it but not watched it. Is it worth watching?\r\n26.08.2024 00:53:24 - Amanda: It's a bit complicated but if you love Nolan's movies, you'll enjoy it.\r\n26.08.2024 00:55:06 - Paulette: I do enjoy his movies. I'll give it a go then. Thanks, Amanda!\r\n26.08.2024 00:56:02 - Amanda: You're welcome! Enjoy your movie night, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 05:32:44 - Amanda: Hi Paulette, have you ever pondered about the concept of existence? What it truly means to exist?\r\n26.08.2024 05:34:36 - Paulette: Hello Amanda, that's a deep question. I think existence is subjective. It's different for every individual based on their perception.\r\n26.08.2024 05:35:15 - Amanda: That's an interesting viewpoint. What about the idea of reality? Do you think our reality is constructed by our minds or is it an independent entity?\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:13 - Paulette: I lean towards the concept of constructed reality. Our experiences and perceptions shape our reality.\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:59 - Amanda: So, would you say our thoughts and consciousness shape the reality around us?\r\n26.08.2024 05:38:20 - Paulette: Yes, I believe so. But at the same time, I think there are certain objective truths or realities that exist beyond our perceptions.\r\n26.08.2024 05:39:54 - Amanda: It's fascinating to think about, isn't it? How our minds can potentially shape the world around us.\r\n26.08.2024 05:41:00 - Paulette: Definitely, it's an intriguing subject. Philosophy really makes you question the world and your place in it.\r\n26.08.2024 11:07:10 - Amanda: Hey Paulette, have you tried that new Italian restaurant downtown?\r\n26.08.2024 11:09:07 - Paulette: Hi Amanda, are you talking about Bella Napoli?\r\n26.08.2024 11:10:16 - Amanda: Yes, that's the one! I heard it's really good.\r\n26.08.2024 11:11:02 - Paulette: I've been there once. The pasta was amazing!\r\n26.08.2024 11:12:03 - Amanda: Really? What else did you try?\r\n26.08.2024 11:13:45 - Paulette: I also had the tiramisu. It was absolutely delicious.\r\n26.08.2024 11:14:49 - Amanda: That sounds great. I'm thinking of going there this weekend.\r\n26.08.2024 11:15:27 - Paulette: You should! And make sure to try their seafood risotto. It's their specialty.\r\n26.08.2024 11:17:22 - Amanda: Seafood risotto, got it. Thanks for the recommendation, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 11:18:50 - Paulette: You're welcome, Amanda.

Is it good?\r\n26.08.2024 15:19:11 - Amanda: It's amazing! I love how they've developed the characters.\r\n26.08.2024 15:20:43 - Paulette: That sounds promising. I'll have to catch up soon.\r\n26.08.2024 15:22:33 - Amanda: You should! Oh, and have you seen The Witcher?\r\n26.08.2024 15:23:44 - Paulette: No, I haven't. Is it worth a watch?\r\n26.08.2024 15:25:10 - Amanda: Absolutely! The storyline is so intriguing.\r\n26.08.2024 15:27:05 - Paulette: I'll add that to my list too then. Thanks for the recommendations, Amanda.\r\n26.08.2024 15:27:55 - Amanda: You're welcome, Paulette! Enjoy your TV time.\r\n26.08.2024 15:29:51 - Paulette: Definitely will.

It's a memoir about a woman who grows up in a strict and abusive household in rural Idaho but eventually goes on to earn a PhD from Cambridge.\r\n01.06.2022 09:53:22 - Justin: Sounds intense Elizabeth. I've been reading 'The Silent Patient'. It's a psychological thriller about a woman who refuses to speak after allegedly murdering her husband.\r\n01.06.2022 09:53:57 - Joseph: I've heard about 'The Silent Patient', Justin. It's supposed to have a great twist at the end.\r\n01.06.2022 09:54:39 - Elizabeth: Oh, that sounds interesting, Justin. I might check it out after I'm done with my current read.\r\n01.06.2022 09:55:13 - Justin: You should, Elizabeth. It's a page-turner.\r\n01.06.2022 09:55:49 - Joseph: I'm looking for something a bit lighter. Any recommendations?\r\n01.06.2022 09:57:29 - Elizabeth: How about 'Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine'? It's a heartwarming story about friendship and self-discovery.\r\n01.06.2022 09:58:09 - Justin: Or 'A Man Called Ove'. It's a funny and touching book about a grumpy old man who finds his world turned upside down when a chatty family moves in next door.\r\n01.06.2022 09:58:51 - Joseph: Thank you, guys. I'll look into these books.\r\n01.06.2022 13:31:34 - Joseph: Hey guys, do you remember when we used to fight over the remote control?\r\n01.06.2022 13:32:18 - Elizabeth: Oh yes, those were the days. Justin, you always wanted to watch cartoons.\r\n01.06.2022 13:33:27 - Justin: And you, Liz, always wanted to watch those boring documentaries!\r\n01.06.2022 13:34:43 - Joseph: And now, look at us.

Do you still play now?\r\n27.08.2024 09:07:16 - Scharron: Not as much as I'd like to, but I try to keep up with it.\r\n27.08.2024 09:08:39 - Nicholas: That's nice. It's important to keep doing what you love.\r\n27.08.2024 09:10:11 - Scharron: Absolutely. Maybe we can play a game sometime!\r\n27.08.2024 09:12:08 - Nicholas: That sounds like a great idea!\r\n27.08.2024 10:01:12 - Nicholas: Hey Scharron, have you ever had a lucid dream?\r\n27.08.2024 10:02:48 - Scharron: Hi Nicholas, yes I have. It's quite a fascinating experience.\r\n27.08.2024 10:04:19 - Nicholas: Really? Can you control what happens in those dreams?\r\n27.08.2024 10:05:36 - Scharron: To some extent, yes. But it takes practice and not all dreams are lucid.\r\n27.08.2024 10:07:15 - Nicholas: I see. I want to learn how to have lucid dreams. Any advice?\r\n27.08.2024 10:08:25 - Scharron: Well, it involves recognizing that you're dreaming while you're in the dream. A trick is to look for details that don't make sense in real life.\r\n27.08.2024 10:09:20 - Nicholas: That sounds challenging but fun. I'll give it a try.\r\n27.08.2024 10:10:30 - Scharron: Good luck, Nicholas! Remember, it might take time. Don't get frustrated.\r\n27.08.2024 10:11:15 - Nicholas: Thanks for the advice, Scharron. I'll keep that in mind.\r\n27.08.2024 10:13:13 - Scharron: You're welcome, Nicholas.

How about you?\r\n27.08.2024 13:36:01 - Nicholas: I'm good too. Been wondering how the kids are doing.\r\n27.08.2024 13:37:35 - Scharron: They're all fine. Growing up so fast. The eldest just started middle school.\r\n27.08.2024 13:39:15 - Nicholas: Wow, time flies. How are they coping with the new environment?\r\n27.08.2024 13:40:02 - Scharron: They're adjusting well. It's a bit challenging but they're managing.\r\n27.08.2024 13:41:56 - Nicholas: That's good to hear. And how's your husband?\r\n27.08.2024 13:43:23 - Scharron: He's doing well. Busy with work as always.\r\n27.08.2024 13:45:12 - Nicholas: Send my regards to him. We should plan a family get together soon.\r\n27.08.2024 13:46:47 - Scharron: That sounds like a great idea. The kids would love that.\r\n27.08.2024 19:13:44 - Nicholas: Hey Scharron, any plans for the weekend?\r\n27.08.2024 19:15:26 - Scharron: Not sure yet, maybe just some Netflix and chill. How about you?\r\n27.08.2024 19:16:46 - Nicholas: I'm thinking about going hiking, the weather should be good.\r\n27.08.2024 19:18:12 - Scharron: That sounds fun, where are you planning to go?\r\n27.08.2024 19:19:59 - Nicholas: Probably the local national park, wanna join?\r\n27.08.2024 19:20:32 - Scharron: I'd love to, but I am not feeling too adventurous lately.\r\n27.08.2024 19:21:04 - Nicholas: No problem, maybe next time. We could do a movie night instead?\r\n27.08.2024 19:21:47 - Scharron: Sure, that sounds great. Any movie suggestions?\r\n27.08.2024 19:22:59 - Nicholas: How about 'The Shawshank Redemption'? It's a classic.\r\n27.08.2024 19:23:36 - Scharron: Oh, I love that movie. It's a deal then.\r\n27.08.2024 19:24:35 - Nicholas: Great, see you on Saturday then.\r\n27.08.2024 19:25:28 - Scharron: Looking forward to it, see you!\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

The episode was mind-blowing, wasn't it?\r\n27.08.2024 04:51:46 - Nicholas: Absolutely, I never expected Walt to take such a drastic step.\r\n27.08.2024 04:52:29 - Scharron: True, the character development is really interesting in this series.\r\n27.08.2024 04:53:28 - Nicholas: I agree.

I'll start - I love painting, it's my way of expressing my creativity and it relaxes me.\r\n05.08.2022 04:27:56 - Salik: That's cool, Sydney. I enjoy playing the guitar. I find it therapeutic.\r\n05.08.2022 04:29:30 - Aliyah: I didn't know that, Salik. I love baking. There's something satisfying about creating something tasty from scratch.\r\n05.08.2022 04:31:07 - Chester: Interesting hobbies everyone! I'm a big fan of hiking. Being in nature and the physical activity really clears my mind.\r\n05.08.2022 04:32:51 - Alex: Wow, we have some diverse interests here. Sydney, have you ever considered selling your paintings?\r\n05.08.2022 04:34:31 - Sydney: I've thought about it, Alex. But for now, I just enjoy doing it for myself. Salik, do you play in a band or just for fun?\r\n05.08.2022 04:35:29 - Salik: Just for fun, Sydney. But I do dream of performing on stage one day.\r\n05.08.2022 04:37:12 - Aliyah: That would be amazing, Salik. Chester, where's your favorite place to hike?\r\n05.08.2022 04:38:14 - Chester: I love hiking in the Rockies, Aliyah. The views are incredible.\r\n05.08.2022 04:38:55 - Alex: Those sound like great experiences.

The Golden Griffin, it's called.\r\n05.08.2022 14:00:39 - Sydney: Sounds exotic. What's the story?\r\n05.08.2022 14:01:41 - Salik: It's a priceless artifact, last seen in the vault of a billionaire tycoon.\r\n05.08.2022 14:03:11 - Aliyah: Getting into that vault won't be easy. We'll need a solid plan.\r\n05.08.2022 14:04:25 - Chester: And the right tools. I can handle that part.\r\n05.08.2022 14:05:37 - Alex: Sydney, start gathering intel on the tycoon's security measures.\r\n05.08.2022 14:07:23 - Sydney: On it. Salik, let's touch base later. We need to map out the building.\r\n05.08.2022 14:08:28 - Salik: Agreed. Aliyah, can you work on possible escape routes?\r\n05.08.2022 14:10:12 - Aliyah: Sure thing. Chester, I'll need your help with that.\r\n05.08.2022 14:11:55 - Chester: No problem, Aliyah. We've got this.\r\n05.08.2022 14:13:30 - Alex: Let's meet tomorrow at dawn.

I can't believe they went into overtime!\r\n05.08.2022 17:09:31 - Salik: I missed it, had to work late. Who won in the end?\r\n05.08.2022 17:10:47 - Aliyah: The Tigers did. They scored a goal in the last minute. It was really exciting!\r\n05.08.2022 17:11:58 - Chester: I knew it! I bet on them. They've been playing really well this season.\r\n05.08.2022 17:13:58 - Alex: Chester, you're always lucky with your bets.\r\n05.08.2022 17:15:09 - Salik: Can someone tell me the final score?\r\n05.08.2022 17:16:18 - Sydney: It was 3-2 for the Tigers.\r\n05.08.2022 17:17:10 - Aliyah: Salik, you should really try to catch the next game. It's against the Hawks, it's going to be a good one.\r\n05.08.2022 17:18:42 - Chester: I agree with Aliyah. The Hawks are a tough team, it's going to be a great match.\r\n05.08.2022 17:20:06 - Alex: Let's all watch it together. Game night at my place?\r\n05.08.2022 17:22:01 - Sydney: Sounds good to me. What about you guys?\r\n05.08.2022 17:23:29 - Salik: I'm in. Thanks, Alex.\r\n05.08.2022 17:24:00 - Aliyah: Me too. Looking forward to it.\r\n05.08.2022 17:25:56 - Chester: Count me in. I'll bring the snacks.\r\n05.08.2022 18:27:40 - Alex: Hello everyone, have you ever thought about the concept of free will versus determinism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:28:42 - Sydney: That's a deep topic, Alex. I believe in determinism. Every action we take is a result of some previous action or event.\r\n05.08.2022 18:30:07 - Salik: Interesting Sydney, but I lean more towards free will. I think we have the power to make our own choices, independent of any predetermined path.\r\n05.08.2022 18:31:37 - Aliyah: I think it's a mix of both. Our surroundings and upbringing might shape us, but we still have the power to make decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:32:11 - Chester: Both views have merit, but I'm intrigued by the notion of compatibilism, which combines free will and determinism. It suggests that free will is compatible with determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:33:35 - Alex: That's a fascinating perspective, Chester. Can we dive deeper into compatibilism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:34:44 - Sydney: Sure, we can look at it in terms of cause and effect. Compatibilism suggests that our actions are both caused by previous events and also by our decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:36:34 - Salik: So, in essence, it's like saying although our choices are influenced, they're still our choices. That's a thought-provoking take.\r\n05.08.2022 18:38:18 - Aliyah: I like the idea of compatibilism. It seems to provide a balance between free will and determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:40:00 - Chester: Exactly, Aliyah. It's all about finding that balance. It's a complex topic, but worth exploring in depth.\r\n05.08.2022 19:34:49 - Alex: Hey guys, have you listened to the new album by The Weeknd?\r\n05.08.2022 19:35:20 - Sydney: Yeah, I did. His sound has really evolved, I love it!\r\n05.08.2022 19:36:13 - Salik: I haven't yet. Is it worth a listen?\r\n05.08.2022 19:36:45 - Aliyah: Definitely, Salik. He has really outdone himself this time.\r\n05.08.2022 19:37:53 - Chester: I'm more of a classic rock guy, but I'll give it a listen.\r\n05.08.2022 19:38:52 - Alex: That's the spirit, Chester. Music is all about exploring different genres.\r\n05.08.2022 19:40:45 - Sydney: True, Alex. By the way, has anyone been to a live concert recently?\r\n05.08.2022 19:42:43 - Salik: No, but I'm planning to attend the Jazz festival next month.\r\n05.08.2022 19:43:34 - Aliyah: That sounds exciting, Salik. I wish I could join.\r\n05.08.2022 19:45:34 - Chester: I attended a Metallica concert last year.

I'll start - I love painting, it's my way of expressing my creativity and it relaxes me.\r\n05.08.2022 04:27:56 - Salik: That's cool, Sydney. I enjoy playing the guitar. I find it therapeutic.\r\n05.08.2022 04:29:30 - Aliyah: I didn't know that, Salik. I love baking.

Being in nature and the physical activity really clears my mind.\r\n05.08.2022 04:32:51 - Alex: Wow, we have some diverse interests here. Sydney, have you ever considered selling your paintings?\r\n05.08.2022 04:34:31 - Sydney: I've thought about it, Alex. But for now, I just enjoy doing it for myself. Salik, do you play in a band or just for fun?\r\n05.08.2022 04:35:29 - Salik: Just for fun, Sydney. But I do dream of performing on stage one day.\r\n05.08.2022 04:37:12 - Aliyah: That would be amazing, Salik. Chester, where's your favorite place to hike?\r\n05.08.2022 04:38:14 - Chester: I love hiking in the Rockies, Aliyah.

The Golden Griffin, it's called.\r\n05.08.2022 14:00:39 - Sydney: Sounds exotic. What's the story?\r\n05.08.2022 14:01:41 - Salik: It's a priceless artifact, last seen in the vault of a billionaire tycoon.\r\n05.08.2022 14:03:11 - Aliyah: Getting into that vault won't be easy. We'll need a solid plan.\r\n05.08.2022 14:04:25 - Chester: And the right tools. I can handle that part.\r\n05.08.2022 14:05:37 - Alex: Sydney, start gathering intel on the tycoon's security measures.\r\n05.08.2022 14:07:23 - Sydney: On it. Salik, let's touch base later. We need to map out the building.\r\n05.08.2022 14:08:28 - Salik: Agreed. Aliyah, can you work on possible escape routes?\r\n05.08.2022 14:10:12 - Aliyah: Sure thing. Chester, I'll need your help with that.\r\n05.08.2022 14:11:55 - Chester: No problem, Aliyah. We've got this.\r\n05.08.2022 14:13:30 - Alex: Let's meet tomorrow at dawn.

I can't believe they went into overtime!\r\n05.08.2022 17:09:31 - Salik: I missed it, had to work late. Who won in the end?\r\n05.08.2022 17:10:47 - Aliyah: The Tigers did. They scored a goal in the last minute. It was really exciting!\r\n05.08.2022 17:11:58 - Chester: I knew it! I bet on them. They've been playing really well this season.\r\n05.08.2022 17:13:58 - Alex: Chester, you're always lucky with your bets.\r\n05.08.2022 17:15:09 - Salik: Can someone tell me the final score?\r\n05.08.2022 17:16:18 - Sydney: It was 3-2 for the Tigers.\r\n05.08.2022 17:17:10 - Aliyah: Salik, you should really try to catch the next game. It's against the Hawks, it's going to be a good one.\r\n05.08.2022 17:18:42 - Chester: I agree with Aliyah. The Hawks are a tough team, it's going to be a great match.\r\n05.08.2022 17:20:06 - Alex: Let's all watch it together. Game night at my place?\r\n05.08.2022 17:22:01 - Sydney: Sounds good to me.

I'll start - I love painting, it's my way of expressing my creativity and it relaxes me.\r\n05.08.2022 04:27:56 - Salik: That's cool, Sydney. I enjoy playing the guitar. I find it therapeutic.\r\n05.08.2022 04:29:30 - Aliyah: I didn't know that, Salik. I love baking. There's something satisfying about creating something tasty from scratch.\r\n05.08.2022 04:31:07 - Chester: Interesting hobbies everyone! I'm a big fan of hiking. Being in nature and the physical activity really clears my mind.\r\n05.08.2022 04:32:51 - Alex: Wow, we have some diverse interests here. Sydney, have you ever considered selling your paintings?\r\n05.08.2022 04:34:31 - Sydney: I've thought about it, Alex. But for now, I just enjoy doing it for myself. Salik, do you play in a band or just for fun?\r\n05.08.2022 04:35:29 - Salik: Just for fun, Sydney. But I do dream of performing on stage one day.\r\n05.08.2022 04:37:12 - Aliyah: That would be amazing, Salik. Chester, where's your favorite place to hike?\r\n05.08.2022 04:38:14 - Chester: I love hiking in the Rockies, Aliyah. The views are incredible.\r\n05.08.2022 04:38:55 - Alex: Those sound like great experiences. Let's make a pact to try out each other's hobbies sometime.\r\n05.08.2022 10:02:51 - Alex: Hey guys, have you seen the latest concert line-ups?\r\n05.08.2022 10:04:18 - Sydney: No, not yet. Who's performing?\r\n05.08.2022 10:05:49 - Salik: I heard that Coldplay is headlining.\r\n05.08.2022 10:06:23 - Aliyah: Really? I love Coldplay! When is it?\r\n05.08.2022 10:07:32 - Chester: It's on the 30th next month. We should all go.\r\n05.08.2022 10:09:05 - Alex: That sounds like a great idea.

We'll need a solid plan.\r\n05.08.2022 14:04:25 - Chester: And the right tools. I can handle that part.\r\n05.08.2022 14:05:37 - Alex: Sydney, start gathering intel on the tycoon's security measures.\r\n05.08.2022 14:07:23 - Sydney: On it. Salik, let's touch base later. We need to map out the building.\r\n05.08.2022 14:08:28 - Salik: Agreed. Aliyah, can you work on possible escape routes?\r\n05.08.2022 14:10:12 - Aliyah: Sure thing. Chester, I'll need your help with that.\r\n05.08.2022 14:11:55 - Chester: No problem, Aliyah. We've got this.\r\n05.08.2022 14:13:30 - Alex: Let's meet tomorrow at dawn.

I can't believe they went into overtime!\r\n05.08.2022 17:09:31 - Salik: I missed it, had to work late. Who won in the end?\r\n05.08.2022 17:10:47 - Aliyah: The Tigers did. They scored a goal in the last minute. It was really exciting!\r\n05.08.2022 17:11:58 - Chester: I knew it! I bet on them. They've been playing really well this season.\r\n05.08.2022 17:13:58 - Alex: Chester, you're always lucky with your bets.\r\n05.08.2022 17:15:09 - Salik: Can someone tell me the final score?\r\n05.08.2022 17:16:18 - Sydney: It was 3-2 for the Tigers.\r\n05.08.2022 17:17:10 - Aliyah: Salik, you should really try to catch the next game. It's against the Hawks, it's going to be a good one.\r\n05.08.2022 17:18:42 - Chester: I agree with Aliyah. The Hawks are a tough team, it's going to be a great match.\r\n05.08.2022 17:20:06 - Alex: Let's all watch it together. Game night at my place?\r\n05.08.2022 17:22:01 - Sydney: Sounds good to me. What about you guys?\r\n05.08.2022 17:23:29 - Salik: I'm in. Thanks, Alex.\r\n05.08.2022 17:24:00 - Aliyah: Me too. Looking forward to it.\r\n05.08.2022 17:25:56 - Chester: Count me in. I'll bring the snacks.\r\n05.08.2022 18:27:40 - Alex: Hello everyone, have you ever thought about the concept of free will versus determinism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:28:42 - Sydney: That's a deep topic, Alex. I believe in determinism. Every action we take is a result of some previous action or event.\r\n05.08.2022 18:30:07 - Salik: Interesting Sydney, but I lean more towards free will. I think we have the power to make our own choices, independent of any predetermined path.\r\n05.08.2022 18:31:37 - Aliyah: I think it's a mix of both. Our surroundings and upbringing might shape us, but we still have the power to make decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:32:11 - Chester: Both views have merit, but I'm intrigued by the notion of compatibilism, which combines free will and determinism. It suggests that free will is compatible with determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:33:35 - Alex: That's a fascinating perspective, Chester. Can we dive deeper into compatibilism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:34:44 - Sydney: Sure, we can look at it in terms of cause and effect. Compatibilism suggests that our actions are both caused by previous events and also by our decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:36:34 - Salik: So, in essence, it's like saying although our choices are influenced, they're still our choices. That's a thought-provoking take.\r\n05.08.2022 18:38:18 - Aliyah: I like the idea of compatibilism. It seems to provide a balance between free will and determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:40:00 - Chester: Exactly, Aliyah. It's all about finding that balance. It's a complex topic, but worth exploring in depth.\r\n05.08.2022 19:34:49 - Alex: Hey guys, have you listened to the new album by The Weeknd?\r\n05.08.2022 19:35:20 - Sydney: Yeah, I did.

Do you believe dreams have meanings?\r\n16.12.2021 04:44:33 - Brent: Well, I think they can be influenced by our thoughts and experiences. For example, if you've been thinking about freedom or escape, that might explain the flying.\r\n16.12.2021 04:45:38 - Mae: That makes sense. I've been feeling quite stressed at work lately. Maybe I'm yearning for an escape.\r\n16.12.2021 04:46:51 - Brent: It's possible.

That sounds like a fun dream, unless you're scared of cookies.\r\n16.12.2021 04:51:24 - Brent: It was more amusing than scary. Anyway, it's interesting to analyze dreams, isn't it?\r\n16.12.2021 04:53:05 - Mae: Definitely! It gives us a glimpse into our subconscious mind.\r\n16.12.2021 04:54:02 - Brent: Yeah, I agree.

Do you often have dreams where you're flying?\r\n16.12.2021 04:43:16 - Mae: Not really, it's the first time. Do you believe dreams have meanings?\r\n16.12.2021 04:44:33 - Brent: Well, I think they can be influenced by our thoughts and experiences. For example, if you've been thinking about freedom or escape, that might explain the flying.\r\n16.12.2021 04:45:38 - Mae: That makes sense. I've been feeling quite stressed at work lately. Maybe I'm yearning for an escape.\r\n16.12.2021 04:46:51 - Brent: It's possible. Dreams can be a way for our subconscious to communicate with us.\r\n16.12.2021 04:47:58 - Mae: Do you remember your dreams often?\r\n16.12.2021 04:49:01 - Brent: Not always. But there are some dreams that I remember vividly, like the one where I was chased by a giant cookie.\r\n16.12.2021 04:50:00 - Mae: Ha! That sounds like a fun dream, unless you're scared of cookies.\r\n16.12.2021 04:51:24 - Brent: It was more amusing than scary. Anyway, it's interesting to analyze dreams, isn't it?\r\n16.12.2021 04:53:05 - Mae: Definitely! It gives us a glimpse into our subconscious mind.\r\n16.12.2021 04:54:02 - Brent: Yeah, I agree. Let's share more dreams next time.\r\n16.12.2021 04:56:00 - Mae: Sure thing, Brent. Goodnight for now.\r\n16.12.2021 10:26:36 - Mae: Hey Brent, have you seen the line-up for the upcoming music concert?\r\n16.12.2021 10:28:16 - Brent: Not yet, Mae. Which bands are playing?\r\n16.12.2021 10:29:49 - Mae: The headliners are Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys. They also have some emerging local bands.\r\n16.12.2021 10:31:06 - Brent: That sounds amazing! I'm a big fan of Arctic Monkeys. When is it happening?\r\n16.12.2021 10:32:14 - Mae: It's on the 25th of next month. I was thinking of buying the tickets.\r\n16.12.2021 10:32:48 - Brent: Count me in, Mae. Let's do it! I can't miss this concert.\r\n16.12.2021 10:34:42 - Mae: Great!

Isn't it sending some really cool images?\r\n12.04.2021 08:55:32 - John: Absolutely, the images are stunning. It\u2019s amazing how far we've come in space exploration.\r\n12.04.2021 08:56:27 - Brody: The perseverance rover is also going to look for signs of past microbial life.

It would change everything we know about life in the universe.\r\n12.04.2021 08:58:11 - John: Indeed, it's fascinating!

How about a cat, Brody? They're more independent.\r\n12.04.2021 16:58:32 - Brody: I do like cats. But I'm also considering something a little more unconventional. Like a reptile.\r\n12.04.2021 17:00:23 - Eric: A reptile could be cool! Maybe a bearded dragon or a gecko?\r\n12.04.2021 17:01:18 - John: Reptiles are definitely unique pets.

Let's meet up and finalize everything.\r\n12.04.2021 14:30:55 - Brody: See you guys in an hour. Let's make this count.\r\n12.04.2021 16:55:35 - Brody: Hey guys, I'm thinking of getting a new pet. Any suggestions?\r\n12.04.2021 16:56:05 - Eric: What about a dog, Brody? They're loyal and great companions.\r\n12.04.2021 16:57:53 - John: True, but they require a lot of care and time. How about a cat, Brody? They're more independent.\r\n12.04.2021 16:58:32 - Brody: I do like cats. But I'm also considering something a little more unconventional. Like a reptile.\r\n12.04.2021 17:00:23 - Eric: A reptile could be cool! Maybe a bearded dragon or a gecko?\r\n12.04.2021 17:01:18 - John: Reptiles are definitely unique pets. But remember they also have specific needs, like regulated temperatures.\r\n12.04.2021 17:02:17 - Brody: Yeah, I'll have to do some research. Thanks for the suggestions, guys.\r\n12.04.2021 17:02:49 - Eric: No problem, Brody. Let us know what you decide!\r\n12.04.2021 17:04:24 - John: Yeah, good luck with your decision, Brody!\r\n12.04.2021 20:48:21 - Brody: Hey guys, have you played the new Call of Duty yet?\r\n12.04.2021 20:49:57 - Eric: Not yet, Brody. I've been hooked on the new Assassin's Creed.\r\n12.04.2021 20:51:35 - John: I've been playing CoD non-stop. It's awesome, Eric, you have to try it!\r\n12.04.2021 20:52:28 - Eric: Really, John? What's so good about it?\r\n12.04.2021 20:53:05 - John: The graphics are insane and there's more strategy involved now. Plus, the new maps are really cool.\r\n12.04.2021 20:54:57 - Brody: I second John. The game play has really improved. Plus, there's a lot of new weapons.\r\n12.04.2021 20:56:35 - Eric: Sounds interesting. I'll try it out soon.\r\n12.04.2021 20:58:05 - John: Great! Let's plan a game night soon.\r\n12.04.2021 20:59:26 - Brody: I'm in. Let's do this.\r\n13.04.2021 01:55:12 - Brody: Hey guys, have you seen the latest episode of 'The Crown'?\r\n13.04.2021 01:56:59 - Eric: No, not yet. But I've heard it's really good!\r\n13.04.2021 01:58:25 - John: I've seen it! I think this might be the best season yet.\r\n13.04.2021 01:59:54 - Brody: I agree, John. The acting and storytelling are just top-notch.\r\n13.04.2021 02:01:28 - Eric: You guys are making me so curious. I'm definitely watching it tonight.\r\n13.04.2021 02:02:13 - John: You won't regret it, Eric!\r\n13.04.2021 02:03:27 - Brody: And what about 'Stranger Things'? The new season is about to start.\r\n13.04.2021 02:04:48 - Eric: Oh, I can't wait for that! The trailer looks promising.\r\n13.04.2021 02:05:49 - John: I must admit, I couldn't get into 'Stranger Things'. Maybe I should give it another try.\r\n13.04.2021 02:06:33 - Brody: Yes, you should, John! It's a great show.\r\n13.04.2021 02:07:31 - Eric: Maybe we should organize a watch party for the new season's premiere.\r\n13.04.2021 02:08:58 - John: That sounds like a great idea, Eric!\r\n13.04.2021 02:09:35 - Brody: I'm in!

Have you ever had a recurring dream?\r\n12.04.2022 17:17:18 - Thomas: Yes, I have. It was a strange one where I was flying above a city. \r\n12.04.2022 17:18:03 - David: That sounds fascinating. Do you think it had any specific meaning?\r\n12.04.2022 17:18:48 - Thomas: It's hard to say for sure. But I think it might have represented a desire for freedom and exploration.\r\n12.04.2022 17:20:03 - David: That's a great interpretation. It's amazing how our minds work, isn't it?\r\n12.04.2022 17:21:37 - Thomas: It sure is, David.

I can look into accommodation and travel within Italy.\r\n12.04.2022 06:05:12 - David: Great, I'll take care of the flights and itinerary then.\r\n12.04.2022 06:05:56 - Thomas: Sounds like a plan. Let's start working on this soon.\r\n12.04.2022 06:07:33 - David: Absolutely, we should meet over the weekend to finalize everything.\r\n12.04.2022 06:08:10 - Thomas: Perfect, see you then.\r\n12.04.2022 10:15:30 - David: Hey Thomas, I got an interesting offer for you.\r\n12.04.2022 10:16:42 - Thomas: Really? What's that about?\r\n12.04.2022 10:17:26 - David: I got a mail from a Prince in Nigeria. He's offering a huge reward for helping him transfer his inheritance.\r\n12.04.2022 10:19:26 - Thomas: Haha, that sounds like a classic scam, David.\r\n12.04.2022 10:20:30 - David: Yeah, I know. But it's tempting, isn't it? Imagine if it was real.\r\n12.04.2022 10:22:16 - Thomas: No way, it's a well-known scam. Don't even think about it.\r\n12.04.2022 10:23:47 - David: Just kidding, Thomas. I'm not that naive. But it's fascinating how these scams still exist.\r\n12.04.2022 10:24:37 - Thomas: I agree, it's because some people still fall for them. Always remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.\r\n12.04.2022 10:26:23 - David: Wise words, Thomas. Thanks for the reminder.\r\n12.04.2022 13:56:23 - David: Hey Thomas, have you seen the latest Marvel movie?\r\n12.04.2022 13:57:22 - Thomas: No, not yet. I've been meaning to catch up on them though. Is it any good?\r\n12.04.2022 13:58:57 - David: Yeah, it's quite good. I think you'd like it. It's a bit different from the previous ones.\r\n12.04.2022 13:59:28 - Thomas: Oh, in what way?\r\n12.04.2022 14:01:10 - David: Well, it's a bit darker and more serious. But still has that classic Marvel humor.\r\n12.04.2022 14:01:41 - Thomas: Sounds interesting. I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the recommendation.\r\n12.04.2022 14:02:39 - David: No problem. Let me know what you think when you see it.\r\n12.04.2022 14:04:05 - Thomas: Sure, I'll do that. By the way, have you seen the new Star Wars movie?\r\n12.04.2022 14:05:19 - David: Yes, I have. Didn't quite like it though.\r\n12.04.2022 14:06:55 - Thomas: Really? I thought it was pretty good.\r\n12.04.2022 14:08:02 - David: To each their own, I guess.\r\n12.04.2022 15:59:32 - David: Hey Thomas, I've recently started listening to classical music and I'm loving it\r\n12.04.2022 16:00:42 - Thomas: That's awesome, David! Do you have any favorite composers or pieces yet?\r\n12.04.2022 16:01:12 - David: I've mainly been listening to Beethoven. His Moonlight Sonata is simply beautiful\r\n12.04.2022 16:02:20 - Thomas: I completely agree. Beethoven's work is timeless. I'd also recommend Mozart if you're looking to explore more\r\n12.04.2022 16:04:05 - David: Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check out some of Mozart's works. Do you play any instruments?\r\n12.04.2022 16:05:31 - Thomas: I used to play the piano when I was younger. Nowadays, I just enjoy listening to good music\r\n12.04.2022 16:06:54 - David: That's cool! I've been thinking about learning the guitar. Any tips?\r\n12.04.2022 16:07:26 - Thomas: That's a great choice! Just be patient with yourself and practice regularly.

How about you?\r\n12.04.2022 17:11:48 - David: I am doing well, thanks. I've been thinking about dreams lately.\r\n12.04.2022 17:12:48 - Thomas: Oh really? That's interesting.

They can be influenced by our day-to-day experiences, thoughts, and feelings.\r\n12.04.2022 17:16:28 - David: Interesting. Have you ever had a recurring dream?\r\n12.04.2022 17:17:18 - Thomas: Yes, I have. It was a strange one where I was flying above a city. \r\n12.04.2022 17:18:03 - David: That sounds fascinating. Do you think it had any specific meaning?\r\n12.04.2022 17:18:48 - Thomas: It's hard to say for sure. But I think it might have represented a desire for freedom and exploration.\r\n12.04.2022 17:20:03 - David: That's a great interpretation. It's amazing how our minds work, isn't it?\r\n12.04.2022 17:21:37 - Thomas: It sure is, David.

Make sure to carry an umbrella if you're heading out.\r\n12.04.2022 22:39:46 - David: Will do, Thomas. Hopefully, it clears up soon.\r\n12.04.2022 22:41:29 - Thomas: Fingers crossed, David.

All we need is an email list and a convincing story.\r\n20.03.2022 18:26:34 - Robert: Sounds risky. What if we get caught?\r\n20.03.2022 18:27:32 - Kenneth: And where would we get an email list?\r\n20.03.2022 18:29:14 - Greyson: I know a guy who could get us that. \r\n20.03.2022 18:30:39 - Robert: Still, isn't this illegal?\r\n20.03.2022 18:32:12 - Chris: Only if we get caught.\r\n20.03.2022 18:33:10 - Kenneth: I'm out.

It's a bit different from their usual style. I'm not sure if I like it yet.\r\n20.03.2022 20:03:50 - Greyson: Really? I think it's their best work yet. I love the experimentation they've done.\r\n20.03.2022 20:04:46 - Robert: I have to agree with Kenneth, I'm not a big fan of the new direction. I miss the old Coldplay.\r\n20.03.2022 20:06:18 - Chris: That's fair. What about you, Greyson? Any new music recommendations?\r\n20.03.2022 20:06:51 - Greyson: I've been really into a band called Tame Impala recently.

The Perseverance Rover, right?\r\n21.03.2022 00:55:42 - Greyson: That's correct, Kenneth. It's really impressive how far we've come in space exploration.\r\n21.03.2022 00:56:16 - Robert: I agree, Greyson. It's fascinating to think about what we might discover next.\r\n21.03.2022 00:57:20 - Chris: It's also a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance. No pun intended!\r\n21.03.2022 00:58:54 - Kenneth: Haha good one, Chris.

That's amazing. Imagine if we found evidence of life on Mars.\r\n21.03.2022 01:04:13 - Chris: That would be a game-changer.

Homeschooling the kids is not an easy task.\r\n21.03.2022 02:46:31 - Greyson: Tell me about it, Kenneth. I'm running out of ideas to keep the kids entertained.\r\n21.03.2022 02:48:00 - Robert: I'm lucky that my kids are all grown up. But, I miss my grandchildren. Can't wait to see them.\r\n21.03.2022 02:49:28 - Chris: I feel you, Robert. It's been tough on all of us. Let's hope things get better soon.\r\n21.03.2022 02:50:12 - Kenneth: Yeah, let's stay positive. We're all in this together.\r\n21.03.2022 02:51:25 - Greyson: Agreed.

Let's do it.\r\n21.03.2022 06:08:54 - Chris: Hey guys, have you seen the latest Marvel movie?\r\n21.03.2022 06:09:39 - Kenneth: No, not yet.

It's a bit old but it's really good.\r\n21.03.2022 06:18:07 - Kenneth: Inception is a masterpiece! One of my all-time favorites.\r\n21.03.2022 06:19:01 - Greyson: I second that. Inception is a classic. Definitely worth a rewatch.\r\n21.03.2022 06:20:36 - Robert: I've never watched it, but I'll definitely give it a go.

I'm running out of ideas to keep the kids entertained.\r\n21.03.2022 02:48:00 - Robert: I'm lucky that my kids are all grown up. But, I miss my grandchildren.

It's a bit different from their usual style. I'm not sure if I like it yet.\r\n20.03.2022 20:03:50 - Greyson: Really? I think it's their best work yet. I love the experimentation they've done.\r\n20.03.2022 20:04:46 - Robert: I have to agree with Kenneth, I'm not a big fan of the new direction. I miss the old Coldplay.\r\n20.03.2022 20:06:18 - Chris: That's fair. What about you, Greyson? Any new music recommendations?\r\n20.03.2022 20:06:51 - Greyson: I've been really into a band called Tame Impala recently. They have a unique sound that I think you guys might like.\r\n20.03.2022 20:08:32 - Kenneth: I'll give them a listen, Greyson. Thanks for the suggestion.\r\n20.03.2022 20:10:25 - Robert: Same here.

The Perseverance Rover, right?\r\n21.03.2022 00:55:42 - Greyson: That's correct, Kenneth. It's really impressive how far we've come in space exploration.\r\n21.03.2022 00:56:16 - Robert: I agree, Greyson. It's fascinating to think about what we might discover next.\r\n21.03.2022 00:57:20 - Chris: It's also a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance. No pun intended!\r\n21.03.2022 00:58:54 - Kenneth: Haha good one, Chris. But yes, it's truly inspiring.\r\n21.03.2022 01:00:53 - Greyson: Did you guys know that the rover will also be looking for signs of past microbial life?\r\n21.03.2022 01:02:15 - Robert: Really? That's amazing. Imagine if we found evidence of life on Mars.\r\n21.03.2022 01:04:13 - Chris: That would be a game-changer. It would make us rethink our place in the universe.\r\n21.03.2022 01:04:48 - Kenneth: Indeed. It's an exciting time to be alive!\r\n21.03.2022 01:05:22 - Greyson: Absolutely.

Homeschooling the kids is not an easy task.\r\n21.03.2022 02:46:31 - Greyson: Tell me about it, Kenneth. I'm running out of ideas to keep the kids entertained.\r\n21.03.2022 02:48:00 - Robert: I'm lucky that my kids are all grown up. But, I miss my grandchildren. Can't wait to see them.\r\n21.03.2022 02:49:28 - Chris: I feel you, Robert. It's been tough on all of us. Let's hope things get better soon.\r\n21.03.2022 02:50:12 - Kenneth: Yeah, let's stay positive. We're all in this together.\r\n21.03.2022 02:51:25 - Greyson: Agreed. Let's also plan a virtual get-together for the kids.\r\n21.03.2022 02:53:20 - Robert: That sounds like a great idea, Greyson. Let's do it.\r\n21.03.2022 06:08:54 - Chris: Hey guys, have you seen the latest Marvel movie?\r\n21.03.2022 06:09:39 - Kenneth: No, not yet. Is it worth watching?\r\n21.03.2022 06:10:56 - Chris: Definitely! It's filled with action and the storyline is great!\r\n21.03.2022 06:12:24 - Greyson: I agree with Chris. It's a must-watch movie. Marvel never disappoints.\r\n21.03.2022 06:13:45 - Robert: I've seen it. And yes, it's fantastic. The visual effects are superb!\r\n21.03.2022 06:14:27 - Kenneth: Okay, you guys convinced me. I'll watch it this weekend.\r\n21.03.2022 06:14:57 - Greyson: You won't regret it, Kenneth.\r\n21.03.2022 06:16:27 - Robert: By the way, do you guys have any other movie recommendations?\r\n21.03.2022 06:17:19 - Chris: I recently watched a movie called 'Inception'. It's a bit old but it's really good.\r\n21.03.2022 06:18:07 - Kenneth: Inception is a masterpiece! One of my all-time favorites.\r\n21.03.2022 06:19:01 - Greyson: I second that. Inception is a classic. Definitely worth a rewatch.\r\n21.03.2022 06:20:36 - Robert: I've never watched it, but I'll definitely give it a go. Thanks for the recommendation, guys.\r\n21.03.2022 08:41:58 - Chris: Hey guys, any plans for the weekend? \r\n21.03.2022 08:42:44 - Kenneth: I'm thinking of going hiking. Weather's perfect. \r\n21.03.2022 08:43:19 - Greyson: That sounds like fun. I might join you. \r\n21.03.2022 08:44:41 - Robert: I have a family gathering on Saturday. Maybe Sunday? \r\n21.03.2022 08:45:18 - Chris: Sunday works for me. Kenneth, what about you? \r\n21.03.2022 08:46:38 - Kenneth: Sure, Sunday's good.

And what about your sister?\r\n20.06.2022 23:22:13 - Karen: She's good too, thanks for asking.

It's been a bit overwhelming, but I'm managing. How about you?\r\n21.06.2022 04:05:30 - Helen: I know what you mean. It's a lot different from middle school. I'm doing okay though. Just trying to keep up with all the homework.\r\n21.06.2022 04:06:33 - Karen: Right? I didn't expect so much work. Are you involved in any clubs or sports?\r\n21.06.2022 04:07:14 - Helen: Yeah, I joined the debate team. It's pretty fun. Are you in any?\r\n21.06.2022 04:07:50 - Karen: I'm thinking about joining the art club. I've always enjoyed painting and sketching.\r\n21.06.2022 04:09:07 - Helen: That sounds great! You're really good at art. It would be a good outlet for you.\r\n21.06.2022 04:10:00 - Karen: Thanks, Helen! That's really sweet of you to say. Maybe we can study together sometime?\r\n21.06.2022 04:11:56 - Helen: That sounds like a great idea, Karen. I'd love that. We can help each other out.\r\n21.06.2022 04:13:13 - Karen: Perfect!

It's a bit chilly, but clear skies. How about where you are?\r\n21.06.2022 06:59:53 - Helen: It's actually quite warm here, sunny with a few clouds.\r\n21.06.2022 07:00:31 - Karen: Oh, that sounds lovely. I miss the sunshine.\r\n21.06.2022 07:02:31 - Helen: I can imagine. How's the forecast looking for the rest of the week?\r\n21.06.2022 07:03:48 - Karen: It's supposed to be a bit warmer, but still mostly cloudy. No rain though, which is good.\r\n21.06.2022 07:05:00 - Helen: That's definitely a silver lining. It's supposed to be sunny all week here.\r\n21.06.2022 07:06:18 - Karen: Lucky you! I'll have to visit sometime.\r\n21.06.2022 07:08:10 - Helen: You're always welcome! Let's hope for good weather when you do.\r\n21.06.2022 07:09:11 - Karen: That would be great.

Did you watch the football match last night?\r\n21.06.2022 08:22:02 - Karen: Yes, I did. It was such an intense game!\r\n21.06.2022 08:23:57 - Helen: I agree. The last-minute goal was a total surprise.\r\n21.06.2022 08:24:47 - Karen: Definitely! I thought we were going into overtime.\r\n21.06.2022 08:26:40 - Helen: Me too. I'm glad our team won though.\r\n21.06.2022 08:28:16 - Karen: Same here. Looking forward to the next match!\r\n21.06.2022 08:29:18 - Helen: Yes, hopefully, they keep up the good work.\r\n21.06.2022 08:30:30 - Karen: Fingers crossed!\r\n21.06.2022 12:10:57 - Helen: Hey Karen, have you read any good books lately?\r\n21.06.2022 12:12:36 - Karen: Yes, Helen. I just finished reading \"The Silent Patient\". It was an amazing psychological thriller!\r\n21.06.2022 12:13:45 - Helen: Oh, I've heard about that one. It's by Alex Michaelides, right?\r\n21.06.2022 12:15:03 - Karen: Yes, that's the one. I couldn't put it down, the plot twists were so unexpected!\r\n21.06.2022 12:16:12 - Helen: That sounds like a book I would enjoy. I love thrillers with unexpected plot twists.\r\n21.06.2022 12:17:27 - Karen: Then you should definitely give it a try. What are you currently reading?\r\n21.06.2022 12:18:04 - Helen: I'm reading \"Educated\" by Tara Westover. It's a memoir and it's really gripping!\r\n21.06.2022 12:19:46 - Karen: Oh, I read that last year. It's an incredibly inspiring story.\r\n21.06.2022 12:20:44 - Helen: It really is. Tara's journey is so powerful and moving.\r\n21.06.2022 12:22:42 - Karen: Let's make a book club! We can share and discuss books we've read.\r\n21.06.2022 12:24:34 - Helen: That's a great idea Karen! I'm in. Let's do it.\r\n21.06.2022 16:34:22 - Helen: Hey Karen, we need to discuss our next steps.\r\n21.06.2022 16:35:02 - Karen: I agree, Helen. The previous operation didn\u2019t go as planned.\r\n21.06.2022 16:36:20 - Helen: Yes, we need a new location for manufacturing. Any ideas?\r\n21.06.2022 16:37:26 - Karen: I've found a potential place. It's an old barn, secluded and not in use.\r\n21.06.2022 16:38:44 - Helen: Sounds good. We need to ensure it has the necessary power supply.\r\n21.06.2022 16:39:36 - Karen: Already checked, it's perfect for our needs.\r\n21.06.2022 16:41:03 - Helen: Great. Let's plan a visit to check it out in person.\r\n21.06.2022 16:41:56 - Karen: Agreed. We should also think about security measures.\r\n21.06.2022 16:43:53 - Helen: Absolutely. We can't afford any unexpected surprises.\r\n21.06.2022 16:45:11 - Karen: I'll contact our guy about the security then.\r\n21.06.2022 16:46:31 - Helen: Perfect. Let's keep this operation as discrete as possible.\r\n21.06.2022 16:48:14 - Karen: Absolutely, Helen. We can't afford any slip-ups.\r\n21.06.2022 19:34:28 - Helen: Hey Karen, how's the college search going?\r\n21.06.2022 19:35:33 - Karen: Hi Helen, it's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. There are so many options!\r\n21.06.2022 19:37:18 - Helen: I know right! It's hard to decide which one is the best fit.\r\n21.06.2022 19:38:28 - Karen: Exactly. I'm looking at the course offerings, faculty, location, everything.\r\n21.06.2022 19:39:39 - Helen: Have you visited any campuses yet?\r\n21.06.2022 19:40:34 - Karen: Not yet.

I love thrillers with unexpected plot twists.\r\n21.06.2022 12:17:27 - Karen: Then you should definitely give it a try. What are you currently reading?\r\n21.06.2022 12:18:04 - Helen: I'm reading \"Educated\" by Tara Westover.

Tara's journey is so powerful and moving.\r\n21.06.2022 12:22:42 - Karen: Let's make a book club! We can share and discuss books we've read.\r\n21.06.2022 12:24:34 - Helen: That's a great idea Karen! I'm in. Let's do it.\r\n21.06.2022 16:34:22 - Helen: Hey Karen, we need to discuss our next steps.\r\n21.06.2022 16:35:02 - Karen: I agree, Helen.

Any ideas?\r\n21.06.2022 16:37:26 - Karen: I've found a potential place. It's an old barn, secluded and not in use.\r\n21.06.2022 16:38:44 - Helen: Sounds good.

Just started a new job.\r\n20.06.2022 23:18:15 - Helen: Oh that's great! How is he finding it?\r\n20.06.2022 23:19:30 - Karen: He's enjoying it so far. It's a big change from his old job, but he's adapting.\r\n20.06.2022 23:21:18 - Helen: That's good to hear. And what about your sister?\r\n20.06.2022 23:22:13 - Karen: She's good too, thanks for asking. She just moved to a new city for her studies.\r\n20.06.2022 23:23:24 - Helen: Your siblings seem to be doing really well. You must be proud.\r\n20.06.2022 23:24:02 - Karen: Yes, I am. They've worked hard to get where they are.\r\n20.06.2022 23:24:43 - Helen: I can imagine. My siblings are also a big part of my life.\r\n20.06.2022 23:26:31 - Karen: It's always nice to have siblings to share your life with, isn't it?\r\n21.06.2022 04:03:00 - Helen: Hey Karen, how are you finding high school so far?\r\n21.06.2022 04:04:37 - Karen: Hi Helen! It's been a bit overwhelming, but I'm managing. How about you?\r\n21.06.2022 04:05:30 - Helen: I know what you mean. It's a lot different from middle school. I'm doing okay though. Just trying to keep up with all the homework.\r\n21.06.2022 04:06:33 - Karen: Right? I didn't expect so much work. Are you involved in any clubs or sports?\r\n21.06.2022 04:07:14 - Helen: Yeah, I joined the debate team. It's pretty fun. Are you in any?\r\n21.06.2022 04:07:50 - Karen: I'm thinking about joining the art club. I've always enjoyed painting and sketching.\r\n21.06.2022 04:09:07 - Helen: That sounds great! You're really good at art. It would be a good outlet for you.\r\n21.06.2022 04:10:00 - Karen: Thanks, Helen! That's really sweet of you to say. Maybe we can study together sometime?\r\n21.06.2022 04:11:56 - Helen: That sounds like a great idea, Karen. I'd love that. We can help each other out.\r\n21.06.2022 04:13:13 - Karen: Perfect! Let's plan for that. I'll message you about it later. Thanks, Helen.\r\n21.06.2022 06:56:58 - Helen: Hi Karen, how's the weather over there?\r\n21.06.2022 06:58:34 - Karen: Hi Helen! It's a bit chilly, but clear skies. How about where you are?\r\n21.06.2022 06:59:53 - Helen: It's actually quite warm here, sunny with a few clouds.\r\n21.06.2022 07:00:31 - Karen: Oh, that sounds lovely. I miss the sunshine.\r\n21.06.2022 07:02:31 - Helen: I can imagine. How's the forecast looking for the rest of the week?\r\n21.06.2022 07:03:48 - Karen: It's supposed to be a bit warmer, but still mostly cloudy. No rain though, which is good.\r\n21.06.2022 07:05:00 - Helen: That's definitely a silver lining. It's supposed to be sunny all week here.\r\n21.06.2022 07:06:18 - Karen: Lucky you! I'll have to visit sometime.\r\n21.06.2022 07:08:10 - Helen: You're always welcome! Let's hope for good weather when you do.\r\n21.06.2022 07:09:11 - Karen: That would be great. Fingers crossed.\r\n21.06.2022 08:17:57 - Helen: Hey Karen, how are you?\r\n21.06.2022 08:19:13 - Karen: I'm good, Helen. How about you?\r\n21.06.2022 08:20:47 - Helen: I'm doing well. Did you watch the football match last night?\r\n21.06.2022 08:22:02 - Karen: Yes, I did. It was such an intense game!\r\n21.06.2022 08:23:57 - Helen: I agree. The last-minute goal was a total surprise.\r\n21.06.2022 08:24:47 - Karen: Definitely! I thought we were going into overtime.\r\n21.06.2022 08:26:40 - Helen: Me too. I'm glad our team won though.\r\n21.06.2022 08:28:16 - Karen: Same here. Looking forward to the next match!\r\n21.06.2022 08:29:18 - Helen: Yes, hopefully, they keep up the good work.\r\n21.06.2022 08:30:30 - Karen: Fingers crossed!\r\n21.06.2022 12:10:57 - Helen: Hey Karen, have you read any good books lately?\r\n21.06.2022 12:12:36 - Karen: Yes, Helen. I just finished reading \"The Silent Patient\". It was an amazing psychological thriller!\r\n21.06.2022 12:13:45 - Helen: Oh, I've heard about that one. It's by Alex Michaelides, right?\r\n21.06.2022 12:15:03 - Karen: Yes, that's the one. I couldn't put it down, the plot twists were so unexpected!\r\n21.06.2022 12:16:12 - Helen: That sounds like a book I would enjoy. I love thrillers with unexpected plot twists.\r\n21.06.2022 12:17:27 - Karen: Then you should definitely give it a try. What are you currently reading?\r\n21.06.2022 12:18:04 - Helen: I'm reading \"Educated\" by Tara Westover. It's a memoir and it's really gripping!\r\n21.06.2022 12:19:46 - Karen: Oh, I read that last year. It's an incredibly inspiring story.\r\n21.06.2022 12:20:44 - Helen: It really is. Tara's journey is so powerful and moving.\r\n21.06.2022 12:22:42 - Karen: Let's make a book club! We can share and discuss books we've read.\r\n21.06.2022 12:24:34 - Helen: That's a great idea Karen! I'm in. Let's do it.\r\n21.06.2022 16:34:22 - Helen: Hey Karen, we need to discuss our next steps.\r\n21.06.2022 16:35:02 - Karen: I agree, Helen. The previous operation didn\u2019t go as planned.\r\n21.06.2022 16:36:20 - Helen: Yes, we need a new location for manufacturing. Any ideas?\r\n21.06.2022 16:37:26 - Karen: I've found a potential place. It's an old barn, secluded and not in use.\r\n21.06.2022 16:38:44 - Helen: Sounds good. We need to ensure it has the necessary power supply.\r\n21.06.2022 16:39:36 - Karen: Already checked, it's perfect for our needs.\r\n21.06.2022 16:41:03 - Helen: Great. Let's plan a visit to check it out in person.\r\n21.06.2022 16:41:56 - Karen: Agreed. We should also think about security measures.\r\n21.06.2022 16:43:53 - Helen: Absolutely. We can't afford any unexpected surprises.\r\n21.06.2022 16:45:11 - Karen: I'll contact our guy about the security then.\r\n21.06.2022 16:46:31 - Helen: Perfect. Let's keep this operation as discrete as possible.\r\n21.06.2022 16:48:14 - Karen: Absolutely, Helen. We can't afford any slip-ups.\r\n21.06.2022 19:34:28 - Helen: Hey Karen, how's the college search going?\r\n21.06.2022 19:35:33 - Karen: Hi Helen, it's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. There are so many options!\r\n21.06.2022 19:37:18 - Helen: I know right! It's hard to decide which one is the best fit.\r\n21.06.2022 19:38:28 - Karen: Exactly. I'm looking at the course offerings, faculty, location, everything.\r\n21.06.2022 19:39:39 - Helen: Have you visited any campuses yet?\r\n21.06.2022 19:40:34 - Karen: Not yet. I'm planning to visit a few next month.\r\n21.06.2022 19:42:26 - Helen: That's a good idea. It will give you a feel of the environment.\r\n21.06.2022 19:43:19 - Karen: Yeah, I hope so. I'm also trying to understand the financial aspects.\r\n21.06.2022 19:44:20 - Helen: That's important too. You might want to look at scholarship options.\r\n21.06.2022 19:45:52 - Karen: Definitely. I'm also looking at student loan options just in case.\r\n21.06.2022 19:46:51 - Helen: Do you need any help? I can share some resources.\r\n21.06.2022 19:48:36 - Karen: That would be great, Helen. I appreciate it.\r\n21.06.2022 19:50:07 - Helen: No problem, Karen. We're in this together.\r\n21.06.2022 19:50:47 - Karen: Thanks, Helen.

Is it worth watching?\r\n23.08.2021 21:47:31 - Parker: Definitely, April!

Made my day.\r\n23.08.2021 21:50:09 - Teegan: I'm not really into gaming videos. I prefer educational ones.\r\n23.08.2021 21:51:30 - Kim: Teegan, have you checked out Khan Academy's channel?

Let's finalize the details in our next chat.\r\n24.08.2021 03:23:02 - Parker: Hey guys, do you ever feel like being the eldest sibling is tough?\r\n24.08.2021 03:24:31 - April: Definitely! Always having to set an example and being responsible for the younger ones.\r\n24.08.2021 03:26:23 - Alexander: Funny, as the middle child, I feel like I'm always overlooked!\r\n24.08.2021 03:27:52 - Teegan: I can't relate at all, being an only child.\r\n24.08.2021 03:29:47 - Kim: As the youngest, I feel like I'm always treated like a baby.\r\n24.08.2021 03:30:32 - Parker: I guess it's tough no matter where you fall in the sibling order.\r\n24.08.2021 03:31:10 - April: Yeah, but at the end of the day, I wouldn't trade my siblings for anything.\r\n24.08.2021 03:31:42 - Alexander: Same here. They can be annoying, but I love them.\r\n24.08.2021 03:33:32 - Teegan: I always wished I had a sibling growing up.\r\n24.08.2021 03:34:40 - Kim: Well, we are kind of like a family here, aren't we?\r\n24.08.2021 04:46:30 - Parker: Hey guys, how's the weather where you all are?\r\n24.08.2021 04:47:06 - April: It's pretty cold over here in New York. Snowed a little this morning.\r\n24.08.2021 04:48:22 - Alexander: Nice and sunny in California. Couldn't ask for better weather.\r\n24.08.2021 04:50:02 - Teegan: It's raining cats and dogs here in London. Wish I was in California right now!\r\n24.08.2021 04:51:52 - Kim: It's windy here in Chicago.

I miss the sun.\r\n24.08.2021 04:55:37 - Alexander: Well, I wouldn't mind a bit of snow. We rarely get that here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:57:03 - Teegan: I would trade the rain for snow any day. It's been so gloomy here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:58:44 - Kim: And I wouldn't mind a bit of rain. It would be a nice change from the wind.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:15 - Parker: Maybe we should all swap places for a bit.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:50 - April: That sounds like a great idea, Parker.\r\n24.08.2021 05:01:44 - Alexander: I'm in. Who wants to come to sunny California?\r\n24.08.2021 05:02:47 - Teegan: I'll swap with you, Alexander. You can have the London rain.\r\n24.08.2021 05:04:09 - Kim: And I'll swap with you, April. I could use a bit of snow in my life.\r\n24.08.2021 06:19:01 - Parker: Hey guys, have you started looking into your college applications yet?\r\n24.08.2021 06:20:39 - April: Yeah, I'm so overwhelmed. There are so many options.\r\n24.08.2021 06:22:24 - Alexander: I've narrowed down my choices to a few universities. Now, it's all about writing the perfect application.\r\n24.08.2021 06:23:09 - Teegan: I'm stuck on the essay part. How do you even begin to write about 'a significant experience in your life?'\r\n24.08.2021 06:24:04 - Kim: Maybe start by brainstorming some key moments that had a big impact on you, Teegan.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:10 - Parker: That's a good idea, Kim. And remember, it doesn't have to be something huge. It could be something small that changed your perspective.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:46 - April: I'm also struggling with financial aid. The forms are so confusing.\r\n24.08.2021 06:26:32 - Alexander: I can help with that, April. I've been through it with my older sister.\r\n24.08.2021 06:27:25 - Teegan: That would be great, Alexander. Maybe we can all meet up this weekend to work on our applications together.\r\n24.08.2021 06:29:09 - Kim: That sounds like a plan. Let's do it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:33:38 - Parker: Hey guys, have you tried that new Italian place downtown?\r\n24.08.2021 11:34:58 - April: No, but I've heard good things! What's it called again?\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:16 - Parker: It's called 'La Trattoria'. Really authentic Italian food.\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:57 - Alexander: I'm in! Always up for trying new food spots.\r\n24.08.2021 11:38:19 - Teegan: Sounds great! We should plan a night to go together.\r\n24.08.2021 11:39:14 - Kim: I've been there, the pasta is amazing!\r\n24.08.2021 11:40:50 - April: Okay, I'm sold. Let's do this.\r\n24.08.2021 11:41:24 - Alexander: How about next Friday?\r\n24.08.2021 11:42:27 - Teegan: Works for me.\r\n24.08.2021 11:43:06 - Kim: I'm in too.\r\n24.08.2021 11:44:28 - Parker: Perfect, I'll make a reservation for 5 next Friday.\r\n24.08.2021 11:45:50 - April: Great! Looking forward to it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:46:34 - Alexander: Same here. Can't wait!\r\n24.08.2021 11:47:21 - Teegan: See you guys then!\r\n24.08.2021 11:49:13 - Kim: Excited for some delicious pasta!\r\n24.08.2021 14:30:00 - Parker: Guys, I think we need to discuss the new formula for the product\r\n24.08.2021 14:32:00 - April: Absolutely. We've been getting feedback that the quality isn't as high as it used to be\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:02 - Alexander: That's a big issue. Any problem with the ingredients?\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:48 - Teegan: As far as I can tell, the ingredients are fine. The issue might be in the process\r\n24.08.2021 14:34:25 - Kim: I agree with Teegan. It's not the what, it's the how. We should revisit our process\r\n24.08.2021 14:35:11 - Parker: That's a good point, Kim. We need to ensure we're not cutting corners\r\n24.08.2021 14:36:09 - April: We also need to think about security. The last thing we want is for this operation to get busted\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:04 - Alexander: I've got contacts that can help with securing the operation\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:40 - Teegan: Let's focus on the process first, then we'll sort out security\r\n24.08.2021 14:40:11 - Kim: Agreed.

Always having to set an example and being responsible for the younger ones.\r\n24.08.2021 03:26:23 - Alexander: Funny, as the middle child, I feel like I'm always overlooked!\r\n24.08.2021 03:27:52 - Teegan: I can't relate at all, being an only child.\r\n24.08.2021 03:29:47 - Kim: As the youngest, I feel like I'm always treated like a baby.\r\n24.08.2021 03:30:32 - Parker: I guess it's tough no matter where you fall in the sibling order.\r\n24.08.2021 03:31:10 - April: Yeah, but at the end of the day, I wouldn't trade my siblings for anything.\r\n24.08.2021 03:31:42 - Alexander: Same here. They can be annoying, but I love them.\r\n24.08.2021 03:33:32 - Teegan: I always wished I had a sibling growing up.\r\n24.08.2021 03:34:40 - Kim: Well, we are kind of like a family here, aren't we?\r\n24.08.2021 04:46:30 - Parker: Hey guys, how's the weather where you all are?\r\n24.08.2021 04:47:06 - April: It's pretty cold over here in New York. Snowed a little this morning.\r\n24.08.2021 04:48:22 - Alexander: Nice and sunny in California. Couldn't ask for better weather.\r\n24.08.2021 04:50:02 - Teegan: It's raining cats and dogs here in London. Wish I was in California right now!\r\n24.08.2021 04:51:52 - Kim: It's windy here in Chicago. The Windy City living up to its name.\r\n24.08.2021 04:53:02 - Parker: Sounds like we're all experiencing different weather conditions.\r\n24.08.2021 04:54:17 - April: I wish I was experiencing Alexander's weather right now. I miss the sun.\r\n24.08.2021 04:55:37 - Alexander: Well, I wouldn't mind a bit of snow. We rarely get that here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:57:03 - Teegan: I would trade the rain for snow any day. It's been so gloomy here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:58:44 - Kim: And I wouldn't mind a bit of rain. It would be a nice change from the wind.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:15 - Parker: Maybe we should all swap places for a bit.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:50 - April: That sounds like a great idea, Parker.\r\n24.08.2021 05:01:44 - Alexander: I'm in. Who wants to come to sunny California?\r\n24.08.2021 05:02:47 - Teegan: I'll swap with you, Alexander. You can have the London rain.\r\n24.08.2021 05:04:09 - Kim: And I'll swap with you, April. I could use a bit of snow in my life.\r\n24.08.2021 06:19:01 - Parker: Hey guys, have you started looking into your college applications yet?\r\n24.08.2021 06:20:39 - April: Yeah, I'm so overwhelmed. There are so many options.\r\n24.08.2021 06:22:24 - Alexander: I've narrowed down my choices to a few universities. Now, it's all about writing the perfect application.\r\n24.08.2021 06:23:09 - Teegan: I'm stuck on the essay part. How do you even begin to write about 'a significant experience in your life?'\r\n24.08.2021 06:24:04 - Kim: Maybe start by brainstorming some key moments that had a big impact on you, Teegan.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:10 - Parker: That's a good idea, Kim. And remember, it doesn't have to be something huge. It could be something small that changed your perspective.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:46 - April: I'm also struggling with financial aid. The forms are so confusing.\r\n24.08.2021 06:26:32 - Alexander: I can help with that, April. I've been through it with my older sister.\r\n24.08.2021 06:27:25 - Teegan: That would be great, Alexander. Maybe we can all meet up this weekend to work on our applications together.\r\n24.08.2021 06:29:09 - Kim: That sounds like a plan. Let's do it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:33:38 - Parker: Hey guys, have you tried that new Italian place downtown?\r\n24.08.2021 11:34:58 - April: No, but I've heard good things! What's it called again?\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:16 - Parker: It's called 'La Trattoria'. Really authentic Italian food.\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:57 - Alexander: I'm in! Always up for trying new food spots.\r\n24.08.2021 11:38:19 - Teegan: Sounds great! We should plan a night to go together.\r\n24.08.2021 11:39:14 - Kim: I've been there, the pasta is amazing!\r\n24.08.2021 11:40:50 - April: Okay, I'm sold.

It's not the what, it's the how. We should revisit our process\r\n24.08.2021 14:35:11 - Parker: That's a good point, Kim. We need to ensure we're not cutting corners\r\n24.08.2021 14:36:09 - April: We also need to think about security.

Can't wait for the next episode!\r\n24.08.2021 00:29:35 - Teegan: I'm in. Let's decide the time and platform.\r\n24.08.2021 00:30:52 - Kim: Great! Let's finalize the details in our next chat.\r\n24.08.2021 03:23:02 - Parker: Hey guys, do you ever feel like being the eldest sibling is tough?\r\n24.08.2021 03:24:31 - April: Definitely! Always having to set an example and being responsible for the younger ones.\r\n24.08.2021 03:26:23 - Alexander: Funny, as the middle child, I feel like I'm always overlooked!\r\n24.08.2021 03:27:52 - Teegan: I can't relate at all, being an only child.\r\n24.08.2021 03:29:47 - Kim: As the youngest, I feel like I'm always treated like a baby.\r\n24.08.2021 03:30:32 - Parker: I guess it's tough no matter where you fall in the sibling order.\r\n24.08.2021 03:31:10 - April: Yeah, but at the end of the day, I wouldn't trade my siblings for anything.\r\n24.08.2021 03:31:42 - Alexander: Same here. They can be annoying, but I love them.\r\n24.08.2021 03:33:32 - Teegan: I always wished I had a sibling growing up.\r\n24.08.2021 03:34:40 - Kim: Well, we are kind of like a family here, aren't we?\r\n24.08.2021 04:46:30 - Parker: Hey guys, how's the weather where you all are?\r\n24.08.2021 04:47:06 - April: It's pretty cold over here in New York. Snowed a little this morning.\r\n24.08.2021 04:48:22 - Alexander: Nice and sunny in California. Couldn't ask for better weather.\r\n24.08.2021 04:50:02 - Teegan: It's raining cats and dogs here in London. Wish I was in California right now!\r\n24.08.2021 04:51:52 - Kim: It's windy here in Chicago. The Windy City living up to its name.\r\n24.08.2021 04:53:02 - Parker: Sounds like we're all experiencing different weather conditions.\r\n24.08.2021 04:54:17 - April: I wish I was experiencing Alexander's weather right now. I miss the sun.\r\n24.08.2021 04:55:37 - Alexander: Well, I wouldn't mind a bit of snow. We rarely get that here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:57:03 - Teegan: I would trade the rain for snow any day. It's been so gloomy here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:58:44 - Kim: And I wouldn't mind a bit of rain. It would be a nice change from the wind.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:15 - Parker: Maybe we should all swap places for a bit.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:50 - April: That sounds like a great idea, Parker.\r\n24.08.2021 05:01:44 - Alexander: I'm in. Who wants to come to sunny California?\r\n24.08.2021 05:02:47 - Teegan: I'll swap with you, Alexander. You can have the London rain.\r\n24.08.2021 05:04:09 - Kim: And I'll swap with you, April. I could use a bit of snow in my life.\r\n24.08.2021 06:19:01 - Parker: Hey guys, have you started looking into your college applications yet?\r\n24.08.2021 06:20:39 - April: Yeah, I'm so overwhelmed. There are so many options.\r\n24.08.2021 06:22:24 - Alexander: I've narrowed down my choices to a few universities. Now, it's all about writing the perfect application.\r\n24.08.2021 06:23:09 - Teegan: I'm stuck on the essay part. How do you even begin to write about 'a significant experience in your life?'\r\n24.08.2021 06:24:04 - Kim: Maybe start by brainstorming some key moments that had a big impact on you, Teegan.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:10 - Parker: That's a good idea, Kim. And remember, it doesn't have to be something huge. It could be something small that changed your perspective.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:46 - April: I'm also struggling with financial aid. The forms are so confusing.\r\n24.08.2021 06:26:32 - Alexander: I can help with that, April. I've been through it with my older sister.\r\n24.08.2021 06:27:25 - Teegan: That would be great, Alexander. Maybe we can all meet up this weekend to work on our applications together.\r\n24.08.2021 06:29:09 - Kim: That sounds like a plan. Let's do it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:33:38 - Parker: Hey guys, have you tried that new Italian place downtown?\r\n24.08.2021 11:34:58 - April: No, but I've heard good things! What's it called again?\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:16 - Parker: It's called 'La Trattoria'. Really authentic Italian food.\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:57 - Alexander: I'm in! Always up for trying new food spots.\r\n24.08.2021 11:38:19 - Teegan: Sounds great! We should plan a night to go together.\r\n24.08.2021 11:39:14 - Kim: I've been there, the pasta is amazing!\r\n24.08.2021 11:40:50 - April: Okay, I'm sold. Let's do this.\r\n24.08.2021 11:41:24 - Alexander: How about next Friday?\r\n24.08.2021 11:42:27 - Teegan: Works for me.\r\n24.08.2021 11:43:06 - Kim: I'm in too.\r\n24.08.2021 11:44:28 - Parker: Perfect, I'll make a reservation for 5 next Friday.\r\n24.08.2021 11:45:50 - April: Great! Looking forward to it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:46:34 - Alexander: Same here. Can't wait!\r\n24.08.2021 11:47:21 - Teegan: See you guys then!\r\n24.08.2021 11:49:13 - Kim: Excited for some delicious pasta!\r\n24.08.2021 14:30:00 - Parker: Guys, I think we need to discuss the new formula for the product\r\n24.08.2021 14:32:00 - April: Absolutely. We've been getting feedback that the quality isn't as high as it used to be\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:02 - Alexander: That's a big issue. Any problem with the ingredients?\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:48 - Teegan: As far as I can tell, the ingredients are fine. The issue might be in the process\r\n24.08.2021 14:34:25 - Kim: I agree with Teegan. It's not the what, it's the how. We should revisit our process\r\n24.08.2021 14:35:11 - Parker: That's a good point, Kim. We need to ensure we're not cutting corners\r\n24.08.2021 14:36:09 - April: We also need to think about security. The last thing we want is for this operation to get busted\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:04 - Alexander: I've got contacts that can help with securing the operation\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:40 - Teegan: Let's focus on the process first, then we'll sort out security\r\n24.08.2021 14:40:11 - Kim: Agreed.

How's your weekend going so far?\r\n31.07.2022 21:11:27 - Manuel: Hi Falon! It's been pretty good. I went for a hike in the morning. How about you?\r\n31.07.2022 21:11:57 - Falon: That sounds fun! I've been chilling at home, watching some series. Any plans for Sunday?\r\n31.07.2022 21:12:34 - Manuel: Yes, I plan to visit a museum. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n31.07.2022 21:13:41 - Falon: You should check out the art museum downtown. They have a new exhibition.\r\n31.07.2022 21:15:07 - Manuel: That sounds interesting. Will definitely check it out. Thanks, Falon!\r\n31.07.2022 21:17:03 - Falon: No problem! Enjoy your visit. Let's catch up next week.\r\n31.07.2022 21:18:15 - Manuel: Sure, sounds like a plan.

I think it's really good, especially the song \"Coloratura\".\r\n31.07.2022 23:20:56 - Falon: I agree, \"Coloratura\" is my favorite too. I also loved their collaboration with BTS.\r\n31.07.2022 23:21:56 - Manuel: Yes, that was quite unexpected. But the song \"My Universe\" turned out to be a great blend of two different styles.\r\n31.07.2022 23:23:39 - Falon: Exactly. It's like a perfect fusion of pop and rock. What other genres do you listen to?\r\n31.07.2022 23:24:23 - Manuel: I'm a big fan of jazz and blues. Recently, I've been listening to a lot of Miles Davis.\r\n31.07.2022 23:26:09 - Falon: Oh, Miles Davis is a legend. I personally love \"So What\". It's such a classic.\r\n31.07.2022 23:26:52 - Manuel: Yes, \"So What\" is a masterpiece. Do you play any instruments?\r\n31.07.2022 23:28:06 - Falon: I'm learning to play the guitar. I hope to play like Eric Clapton one day.\r\n31.07.2022 23:28:51 - Manuel: That's cool. Keep practicing and you'll get there. Speaking of Clapton, have you heard his song \"Tears in Heaven\"?\r\n31.07.2022 23:30:40 - Falon: Yes, it's a beautiful song. It always makes me emotional.\r\n31.07.2022 23:31:42 - Manuel: Same here. It's one of those songs that touches your soul.\r\n31.07.2022 23:32:17 - Falon: I totally agree. Music has such a powerful impact on our emotions.\r\n01.08.2022 02:54:34 - Falon: Hey Manuel, have you seen the latest episode of 'The Witcher' yet?\r\n01.08.2022 02:55:35 - Manuel: Hi Falon! Yes, I just finished watching it. It was thrilling!\r\n01.08.2022 02:57:25 - Falon: I know, right? The plot twists were unexpected!\r\n01.08.2022 02:58:24 - Manuel: Absolutely, especially the character development of Geralt. I am really impressed.\r\n01.08.2022 02:59:37 - Falon: Me too! I can't wait for the next episode. Do you have any other series to recommend?\r\n01.08.2022 03:01:00 - Manuel: Yes, I just started watching 'Stranger Things'. It's really good so far.\r\n01.08.2022 03:02:04 - Falon: I've heard a lot about it. What's it about?\r\n01.08.2022 03:03:14 - Manuel: It's a sci-fi horror series. It's about a group of kids in a small town who encounter supernatural phenomena.\r\n01.08.2022 03:04:02 - Falon: Sounds intriguing! I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!\r\n01.08.2022 03:05:29 - Manuel: No problem! Let me know what you think about it.\r\n01.08.2022 03:07:06 - Falon: Sure, I will.

It's going to be a blast. See you there then!\r\n01.08.2022 03:10:28 - Manuel: Definitely!

How about you?\r\n01.08.2022 06:08:25 - Falon: That's amazing! I love painting. I guess we both love art in different forms.\r\n01.08.2022 06:10:18 - Manuel: Yes, indeed. Do you have any of your paintings to share?\r\n01.08.2022 06:11:32 - Falon: Sure, I'd love to share some of my work with you.\r\n01.08.2022 06:13:11 - Manuel: That sounds great. I'd love to see your work.\r\n01.08.2022 06:15:07 - Falon: I'll send some pictures to you tomorrow.\r\n01.08.2022 06:16:34 - Manuel: Looking forward to it, Falon.\r\n01.08.2022 07:55:48 - Falon: Hi Manuel, have you read the new book by J.K. Rowling?\r\n01.08.2022 07:57:01 - Manuel: Hello Falon, no I haven't. Is it worth reading?\r\n01.08.2022 07:58:13 - Falon: Absolutely! It's a fantastic read. I couldn't put it down.\r\n01.08.2022 07:59:52 - Manuel: That sounds intriguing. What's the book about?\r\n01.08.2022 08:00:46 - Falon: It's a mystery novel with a touch of magic, just like her Harry Potter series but for adults.\r\n01.08.2022 08:02:30 - Manuel: Sounds interesting. I loved the Harry Potter series. I'll definitely check it out.\r\n01.08.2022 08:03:26 - Falon: Great! Let me know how you find it.\r\n01.08.2022 08:04:22 - Manuel: Will do. By the way, have you read 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?\r\n01.08.2022 08:05:36 - Falon: Yes, I have. It's a classic. I love how it addresses complex issues through the eyes of a child.\r\n01.08.2022 08:07:32 - Manuel: Exactly! It's one of my all-time favorite books.\r\n01.08.2022 08:08:12 - Falon: Mine too. It's beautifully written.\r\n01.08.2022 08:09:36 - Manuel: I couldn't agree more. Any other book recommendations?\r\n01.08.2022 08:10:46 - Falon: Sure, if you're into historical fiction, 'The Book Thief' is a must-read.\r\n01.08.2022 08:12:14 - Manuel: Thanks for the recommendation, Falon. I'll add it to my list.\r\n01.08.2022 11:09:53 - Falon: Hey Manuel! Have you heard about the upcoming concert next weekend?\r\n01.08.2022 11:11:14 - Manuel: Hi Falon! No, I haven't. Who's performing?\r\n01.08.2022 11:12:10 - Falon: It's Coldplay. They're back on tour and our city is one of their stops.\r\n01.08.2022 11:13:46 - Manuel: Wow! That sounds amazing. I'm a huge fan of their music.\r\n01.08.2022 11:15:21 - Falon: Me too! Would you be interested in going to the concert with me?\r\n01.08.2022 11:16:43 - Manuel: Definitely! Let's do it. Where can we buy the tickets?\r\n01.08.2022 11:18:11 - Falon: We can get them online. I'll send you the link.\r\n01.08.2022 11:19:15 - Manuel: Thanks Falon.

Thanks for the recommendation.\r\n23.03.2022 10:34:10 - Robert: Anytime! Let me know what you think once you\u2019ve seen it.\r\n23.03.2022 10:35:39 - Tiana: Will do.

It's going alright. Just sorting through various colleges.\r\n23.03.2022 11:39:19 - Robert: That's cool. Any favorites yet?\r\n23.03.2022 11:40:04 - Tiana: Well, I've been looking at Stanford and Harvard so far.\r\n23.03.2022 11:40:55 - Robert: Wow, those are great choices! What major are you considering?\r\n23.03.2022 11:42:52 - Tiana: I'm thinking about computer science. But I also love biochemistry.\r\n23.03.2022 11:44:36 - Robert: That's interesting. You know, you can always do a double major or choose one as a minor.\r\n23.03.2022 11:46:01 - Tiana: Yeah, that's true. Just trying to figure out what would be the best fit for me.\r\n23.03.2022 11:47:15 - Robert: You'll figure it out. What about the deadlines? Are they coming up soon?\r\n23.03.2022 11:49:13 - Tiana: Yes, they are.

It's totally different from his previous works.\r\n23.03.2022 16:37:00 - Robert: I agree. It seems like he's experimenting with a new sound. Did you have a favorite track?\r\n23.03.2022 16:38:25 - Tiana: I think \"Save Your Tears\" was pretty good. What about you?\r\n23.03.2022 16:39:35 - Robert: I quite liked \"Blinding Lights\". It has a catchy tune.\r\n23.03.2022 16:41:10 - Tiana: That's true. It's one of those songs that you can't get out of your head.\r\n23.03.2022 16:42:00 - Robert: Do you think this album will win any awards?\r\n23.03.2022 16:42:34 - Tiana: It's hard to say. The competition is tough this year. But I think he might win a few.\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

Nice is also great, especially during the summer.\r\n22.03.2022 23:49:00 - Robert: That's great. Do we need any specific documents for traveling there?\r\n22.03.2022 23:50:09 - Tiana: We need our passports, and France requires a tourist visa for stays longer than 90 days.\r\n22.03.2022 23:51:43 - Robert: Perfect! I'll start preparing the necessary documents.\r\n22.03.2022 23:53:34 - Tiana: Great!

What's up?\r\n23.03.2022 04:01:55 - Robert: Apparently, it has discovered some intriguing rock formations that could potentially indicate past life on Mars.\r\n23.03.2022 04:02:55 - Tiana: Wow, that's fascinating! I'll have to look into it more. Thanks for sharing, Robert!\r\n23.03.2022 04:03:56 - Robert: No problem, Tiana. I thought you'd find it interesting given your interest in space exploration.\r\n23.03.2022 04:04:53 - Tiana: Absolutely!

Remember to take breaks when you need them.\r\n23.03.2022 08:39:22 - Tiana: I will. You do the same, Robert. We often forget to take care of ourselves in the hustle.\r\n23.03.2022 08:40:00 - Robert: You're absolutely right, Tiana.

It has a catchy tune.\r\n23.03.2022 16:41:10 - Tiana: That's true. It's one of those songs that you can't get out of your head.\r\n23.03.2022 16:42:00 - Robert: Do you think this album will win any awards?\r\n23.03.2022 16:42:34 - Tiana: It's hard to say.

Nice is also great, especially during the summer.\r\n22.03.2022 23:49:00 - Robert: That's great. Do we need any specific documents for traveling there?\r\n22.03.2022 23:50:09 - Tiana: We need our passports, and France requires a tourist visa for stays longer than 90 days.\r\n22.03.2022 23:51:43 - Robert: Perfect! I'll start preparing the necessary documents.\r\n22.03.2022 23:53:34 - Tiana: Great!

What's up?\r\n23.03.2022 04:01:55 - Robert: Apparently, it has discovered some intriguing rock formations that could potentially indicate past life on Mars.\r\n23.03.2022 04:02:55 - Tiana: Wow, that's fascinating! I'll have to look into it more. Thanks for sharing, Robert!\r\n23.03.2022 04:03:56 - Robert: No problem, Tiana. I thought you'd find it interesting given your interest in space exploration.\r\n23.03.2022 04:04:53 - Tiana: Absolutely! I'm always amazed by the new things we're discovering about our universe.\r\n23.03.2022 04:06:28 - Robert: Same here. It's a great time to be alive and witness these incredible advancements.\r\n23.03.2022 04:07:06 - Tiana: Definitely! I can't wait to see what they'll discover next on Mars.\r\n23.03.2022 04:08:47 - Robert: Me too, I hope they'll keep us updated.\r\n23.03.2022 08:30:00 - Robert: Good morning, Tiana.

What's on the agenda today?\r\n23.03.2022 08:36:30 - Robert: I have a few meetings and need to finish a report. How about you?\r\n23.03.2022 08:37:47 - Tiana: I need to complete a project and then get to some email backlog. It's going to be a busy day.\r\n23.03.2022 08:38:42 - Robert: Sounds like it. Remember to take breaks when you need them.\r\n23.03.2022 08:39:22 - Tiana: I will. You do the same, Robert. We often forget to take care of ourselves in the hustle.\r\n23.03.2022 08:40:00 - Robert: You're absolutely right, Tiana. Let's promise to look after ourselves better.\r\n23.03.2022 08:40:58 - Tiana: Deal. Have a productive day, Robert.\r\n23.03.2022 08:41:52 - Robert: You too, Tiana.

I loved the previous one so maybe I won't like this as much.\r\n23.03.2022 10:30:45 - Robert: Maybe. But you should still watch it, it\u2019s worth it.\r\n23.03.2022 10:32:34 - Tiana: Yeah, I will. Thanks for the recommendation.\r\n23.03.2022 10:34:10 - Robert: Anytime! Let me know what you think once you\u2019ve seen it.\r\n23.03.2022 10:35:39 - Tiana: Will do.

Any favorites yet?\r\n23.03.2022 11:40:04 - Tiana: Well, I've been looking at Stanford and Harvard so far.\r\n23.03.2022 11:40:55 - Robert: Wow, those are great choices! What major are you considering?\r\n23.03.2022 11:42:52 - Tiana: I'm thinking about computer science. But I also love biochemistry.\r\n23.03.2022 11:44:36 - Robert: That's interesting. You know, you can always do a double major or choose one as a minor.\r\n23.03.2022 11:46:01 - Tiana: Yeah, that's true. Just trying to figure out what would be the best fit for me.\r\n23.03.2022 11:47:15 - Robert: You'll figure it out. What about the deadlines? Are they coming up soon?\r\n23.03.2022 11:49:13 - Tiana: Yes, they are.

Just finished preparing breakfast for the kids.\r\n05.04.2022 07:35:26 - Kenneth: That's great, Rebecca! And Evelyn, what did you make for the kids?\r\n05.04.2022 07:36:31 - Evelyn: Pancakes and scrambled eggs. They love it.\r\n05.04.2022 07:37:20 - Kenneth: Sounds delicious! I have been working since early morning. Need a coffee break now.\r\n05.04.2022 07:38:08 - Rebecca: Oh, take a break Kenneth. I am planning to do some gardening now.\r\n05.04.2022 07:39:59 - Evelyn: Rebecca, that sounds like fun. I'll be working from home today.\r\n05.04.2022 07:40:35 - Kenneth: Me too, Evelyn. Let's catch up in the evening guys?\r\n05.04.2022 07:41:57 - Rebecca: Sure Kenneth. We can do a video call.\r\n05.04.2022 07:42:36 - Evelyn: Great idea! Let's do it.\r\n05.04.2022 11:53:02 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you seen the recent development about the Mars Rover?\r\n05.04.2022 11:54:19 - Rebecca: Yes, Kenneth. It's fascinating how much we're able to explore now!\r\n05.04.2022 11:55:32 - Evelyn: I know right! The images it's sending back are simply amazing.\r\n05.04.2022 11:56:34 - Kenneth: It's like we're on the brink of some revolutionary discoveries.\r\n05.04.2022 11:57:13 - Rebecca: I wonder what implications this could have for future space travel.\r\n05.04.2022 11:58:58 - Evelyn: Definitely. But I also hope we don't forget about taking care of our own planet while we're exploring others.\r\n05.04.2022 12:00:40 - Kenneth: That's a good point, Evelyn. It's all a matter of balance.\r\n05.04.2022 12:02:02 - Rebecca: Well said, both of you. I think this is a conversation that needs to be had on a larger scale.\r\n05.04.2022 12:03:35 - Evelyn: Agree. It's a topic that combines science, ethics, environmentalism... so complex.\r\n05.04.2022 12:05:10 - Kenneth: Let's all keep ourselves updated on this. It's interesting to see where it goes.\r\n05.04.2022 15:19:39 - Kenneth: Good morning, Rebecca and Evelyn\r\n05.04.2022 15:20:14 - Rebecca: Morning Kenneth, how's the project going?\r\n05.04.2022 15:22:08 - Kenneth: It's on track, but we're facing some minor issues with the software\r\n05.04.2022 15:22:41 - Evelyn: I've noticed that too, Kenneth. It's been quite slow lately\r\n05.04.2022 15:24:18 - Rebecca: Should we report this to IT?\r\n05.04.2022 15:25:37 - Kenneth: Yes, please do. In the meantime, let's try to make do with what we have\r\n05.04.2022 15:26:35 - Evelyn: Agreed. I'll also make a list of all the issues we've been having\r\n05.04.2022 15:27:13 - Rebecca: Sounds like a plan. Let's also schedule a meeting to discuss this\r\n05.04.2022 15:28:36 - Kenneth: Good idea, Rebecca. Let's meet at 2pm\r\n05.04.2022 15:29:59 - Evelyn: Works for me. Looking forward to resolving these issues\r\n05.04.2022 15:30:58 - Rebecca: Same here. See you both at 2pm\r\n05.04.2022 15:32:48 - Kenneth: See you then.

I think the character development this season is really interesting!\r\n05.04.2022 21:13:31 - Evelyn: I haven't seen it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n05.04.2022 21:15:29 - Kenneth: Sure thing, Evelyn. But you should catch up soon. It's getting really good.\r\n05.04.2022 21:16:22 - Rebecca: Definitely! And once you're done, Evelyn, we should all discuss it!\r\n05.04.2022 21:17:35 - Evelyn: Sounds like a plan. I'll try to watch it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:01 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you checked out the new podcast by Malcolm Gladwell?\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:41 - Rebecca: Hi Kenneth, not yet. What's it about?\r\n06.04.2022 02:06:11 - Kenneth: It's called \"Revisionist History\". It's about events in the past that have been misunderstood or overlooked. It's quite interesting.\r\n06.04.2022 02:07:47 - Evelyn: Oh, that sounds like something I would enjoy. I love history.\r\n06.04.2022 02:08:43 - Kenneth: You should definitely check it out then, Evelyn. And you too, Rebecca. I think you'll both like it.\r\n06.04.2022 02:10:39 - Rebecca: I'll certainly give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendation, Kenneth!\r\n06.04.2022 02:11:31 - Evelyn: Adding it to my list now. Thanks, Kenneth!\r\n06.04.2022 02:13:04 - Kenneth: You're welcome! Let me know what you think once you've listened to it.\r\n06.04.2022 02:14:32 - Rebecca: Will do!\r\n06.04.2022 02:16:13 - Evelyn: Same here!\r\n06.04.2022 07:28:43 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you seen the latest episode of 'The Crown' on Netflix?\r\n06.04.2022 07:30:11 - Rebecca: Hi Kenneth, yes I watched it last night. So much drama! Evelyn, have you seen it yet?\r\n06.04.2022 07:31:58 - Evelyn: I haven't gotten around to it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n06.04.2022 07:32:36 - Kenneth: No worries, Evelyn. We'll keep it spoiler-free. But you definitely need to catch up soon!\r\n06.04.2022 07:34:05 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Evelyn. The performances this season are top-notch. They've really outdone themselves.\r\n06.04.2022 07:35:07 - Evelyn: Sounds exciting! I'll make sure to start watching it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 07:36:26 - Kenneth: Great! We can discuss it more once you've seen it. In other news, have you guys heard about the new Star Wars series in development?\r\n06.04.2022 07:38:12 - Rebecca: Yes, I read about it. It's supposed to be set in a completely different timeline, right?\r\n06.04.2022 07:39:56 - Evelyn: That's right. I'm really looking forward to seeing a new side of the Star Wars universe.\r\n06.04.2022 07:41:48 - Kenneth: Me too, it's about time they explored other aspects. I'm quite excited about it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:42:27 - Rebecca: I'm cautiously optimistic. Let's hope they do a good job with it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:43:09 - Evelyn: Agreed. But for now, I'm off to start 'The Crown'. Talk to you guys later!\r\n06.04.2022 11:59:15 - Kenneth: Hello Rebecca and Evelyn, I've been thinking about the concept of free will lately. Do you think our choices are truly ours, or are they predetermined by factors beyond our control?\r\n06.04.2022 12:00:26 - Rebecca: I think it's a mix of both, Kenneth. Some choices are influenced by our surroundings, but we also have the ability to make conscious decisions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:02:11 - Evelyn: Interesting perspective, Rebecca. I often lean more towards determinism though. I believe that every event, including human cognition and behavior, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences.\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:05 - Kenneth: That's a valid point, Evelyn. But doesn't that undermine the notion of moral responsibility? If our actions are predetermined, can we be held accountable for them?\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:44 - Rebecca: I think that's where compatibilism comes in. It's the idea that free will and determinism can coexist. We can make choices, but those choices are influenced by a variety of factors.\r\n06.04.2022 12:06:31 - Evelyn: Yes, Rebecca. Compatibilism is a compelling perspective. It allows for complexity in our understanding of free will and determinism.\r\n06.04.2022 12:07:13 - Kenneth: I agree. It's a complex issue with no clear-cut answers. It's always fascinating to delve into these philosophical discussions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:00 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Kenneth. These discussions always leave me with more questions than answers, but I suppose that's the beauty of philosophy.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:42 - Evelyn: Well said, Rebecca. It's the pursuit of wisdom and understanding that makes philosophy so captivating.\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

It's all a matter of balance.\r\n05.04.2022 12:02:02 - Rebecca: Well said, both of you. I think this is a conversation that needs to be had on a larger scale.\r\n05.04.2022 12:03:35 - Evelyn: Agree. It's a topic that combines science, ethics, environmentalism... so complex.\r\n05.04.2022 12:05:10 - Kenneth: Let's all keep ourselves updated on this.

I think the character development this season is really interesting!\r\n05.04.2022 21:13:31 - Evelyn: I haven't seen it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n05.04.2022 21:15:29 - Kenneth: Sure thing, Evelyn. But you should catch up soon. It's getting really good.\r\n05.04.2022 21:16:22 - Rebecca: Definitely! And once you're done, Evelyn, we should all discuss it!\r\n05.04.2022 21:17:35 - Evelyn: Sounds like a plan. I'll try to watch it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:01 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you checked out the new podcast by Malcolm Gladwell?\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:41 - Rebecca: Hi Kenneth, not yet. What's it about?\r\n06.04.2022 02:06:11 - Kenneth: It's called \"Revisionist History\". It's about events in the past that have been misunderstood or overlooked. It's quite interesting.\r\n06.04.2022 02:07:47 - Evelyn: Oh, that sounds like something I would enjoy. I love history.\r\n06.04.2022 02:08:43 - Kenneth: You should definitely check it out then, Evelyn. And you too, Rebecca. I think you'll both like it.\r\n06.04.2022 02:10:39 - Rebecca: I'll certainly give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendation, Kenneth!\r\n06.04.2022 02:11:31 - Evelyn: Adding it to my list now.

So much drama! Evelyn, have you seen it yet?\r\n06.04.2022 07:31:58 - Evelyn: I haven't gotten around to it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n06.04.2022 07:32:36 - Kenneth: No worries, Evelyn. We'll keep it spoiler-free. But you definitely need to catch up soon!\r\n06.04.2022 07:34:05 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Evelyn. The performances this season are top-notch. They've really outdone themselves.\r\n06.04.2022 07:35:07 - Evelyn: Sounds exciting! I'll make sure to start watching it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 07:36:26 - Kenneth: Great! We can discuss it more once you've seen it. In other news, have you guys heard about the new Star Wars series in development?\r\n06.04.2022 07:38:12 - Rebecca: Yes, I read about it. It's supposed to be set in a completely different timeline, right?\r\n06.04.2022 07:39:56 - Evelyn: That's right. I'm really looking forward to seeing a new side of the Star Wars universe.\r\n06.04.2022 07:41:48 - Kenneth: Me too, it's about time they explored other aspects. I'm quite excited about it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:42:27 - Rebecca: I'm cautiously optimistic. Let's hope they do a good job with it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:43:09 - Evelyn: Agreed. But for now, I'm off to start 'The Crown'. Talk to you guys later!\r\n06.04.2022 11:59:15 - Kenneth: Hello Rebecca and Evelyn, I've been thinking about the concept of free will lately. Do you think our choices are truly ours, or are they predetermined by factors beyond our control?\r\n06.04.2022 12:00:26 - Rebecca: I think it's a mix of both, Kenneth. Some choices are influenced by our surroundings, but we also have the ability to make conscious decisions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:02:11 - Evelyn: Interesting perspective, Rebecca. I often lean more towards determinism though. I believe that every event, including human cognition and behavior, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences.\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:05 - Kenneth: That's a valid point, Evelyn. But doesn't that undermine the notion of moral responsibility? If our actions are predetermined, can we be held accountable for them?\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:44 - Rebecca: I think that's where compatibilism comes in. It's the idea that free will and determinism can coexist. We can make choices, but those choices are influenced by a variety of factors.\r\n06.04.2022 12:06:31 - Evelyn: Yes, Rebecca. Compatibilism is a compelling perspective. It allows for complexity in our understanding of free will and determinism.\r\n06.04.2022 12:07:13 - Kenneth: I agree. It's a complex issue with no clear-cut answers. It's always fascinating to delve into these philosophical discussions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:00 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Kenneth. These discussions always leave me with more questions than answers, but I suppose that's the beauty of philosophy.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:42 - Evelyn: Well said, Rebecca. It's the pursuit of wisdom and understanding that makes philosophy so captivating.\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

It was so vivid.\r\n02.04.2022 02:40:53 - Geraldine: That's fascinating, Sarah. Dreams can sometimes be a reflection of our subconscious mind.

I felt very calm there.\r\n02.04.2022 02:43:02 - Geraldine: That sounds like a beautiful dream, Sarah.

Is it worth watching?\r\n22.09.2022 16:57:52 - Steven: I saw it this morning. It's about the impact of AI on video editing. Quite fascinating.\r\n22.09.2022 16:59:00 - Meredith: Exactly, Steven!

I think it's one of the best so far. The acting was superb.\r\n23.09.2022 04:20:33 - Steven: I agree with Roy. The detailing was also remarkable. They've really tried to keep things historically accurate.\r\n23.09.2022 04:21:57 - Meredith: Yeah, I was reading about that. It's interesting how they've managed to capture the essence of the era.\r\n23.09.2022 04:22:40 - Steven: True. But have you guys seen 'Breaking Bad'? It's a different genre but the storytelling is brilliant.\r\n23.09.2022 04:23:25 - Roy: I've heard about it but never got around to watching it. Would you recommend it, Steven?\r\n23.09.2022 04:24:32 - Steven: Absolutely! It's a must-watch. The character development is unlike any other show.\r\n23.09.2022 04:26:24 - Meredith: I'll add it to my list then.

Do you have any preferences in terms of size, lifespan, etc.?\r\n23.09.2022 07:04:18 - Meredith: I am thinking of a smaller pet due to my apartment size. Any ideas?\r\n23.09.2022 07:05:12 - Roy: How about a cat? They are relatively low maintenance and perfect for apartments.\r\n23.09.2022 07:06:46 - Steven: A hamster could also be a good option. They are small and easy to take care of.\r\n23.09.2022 07:08:07 - Meredith: Thanks for the suggestions, guys. I'll look into both cats and hamsters.\r\n23.09.2022 07:09:37 - Roy: You're welcome, Meredith.

How about you?\r\n09.09.2021 06:03:45 - Rylan: I'm good, thanks. I was just watching the basketball game. It's a close one.\r\n09.09.2021 06:05:20 - Phyllis: Oh, which teams are playing?\r\n09.09.2021 06:06:27 - Rylan: The Lakers and the Celtics. It's a classic rivalry.\r\n09.09.2021 06:07:27 - Phyllis: That sounds exciting! Who's leading?\r\n09.09.2021 06:08:44 - Rylan: The Lakers are up by 3 points right now, but there's still plenty of time left.\r\n09.09.2021 06:09:42 - Phyllis: I'm rooting for the Celtics. They have a great team this season.\r\n09.09.2021 06:10:35 - Rylan: They do indeed. But I'm a Lakers fan, so we're on opposite sides for this one!\r\n09.09.2021 06:11:57 - Phyllis: May the best team win then!\r\n09.09.2021 11:08:37 - Rylan: Hey Phyllis, did you catch the latest episode of The Crown?\r\n09.09.2021 11:10:29 - Phyllis: Hi Rylan, yes I did!

He's phenomenal!\r\n09.09.2021 11:15:31 - Phyllis: Yes, his performance is quite captivating. I'm also really enjoying Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret.\r\n09.09.2021 11:17:17 - Rylan: She's always been one of my favorite actresses. Her versatility is just amazing.\r\n09.09.2021 11:18:05 - Phyllis: Indeed. Can't wait for the next episode!\r\n09.09.2021 11:19:30 - Rylan: Me too. Let's plan a watch party for it.\r\n09.09.2021 11:20:59 - Phyllis: That sounds like a great idea, Rylan!

Any tips?\r\n12.03.2022 18:33:17 - John: I found watching some tutorial videos really helpful, Tre. Try that.\r\n12.03.2022 18:34:46 - Cindy: Also, always remember to use a stiff brush and very little paint for dry brushing.\r\n12.03.2022 18:35:21 - Jaiden: Great tips, guys! Let's keep practicing and share our artworks next week.\r\n12.03.2022 18:35:55 - John: Sounds like a plan. Looking forward to it.\r\n12.03.2022 18:37:06 - Tre: Me too.

See you all there.\r\n13.03.2022 00:18:34 - John: Looking forward to it.\r\n13.03.2022 00:19:23 - Jaiden: It's a date then. See you all on Saturday.\r\n13.03.2022 02:29:45 - Jaiden: Hey guys, I've started a new diet recently, any tips?\r\n13.03.2022 02:30:27 - Cindy: That's great Jaiden! Make sure you're eating a balanced diet, not just restricting certain food groups.\r\n13.03.2022 02:31:45 - Tre: Agreed with Cindy. Also, remember to drink lots of water.\r\n13.03.2022 02:33:08 - John: Absolutely! Exercise is just as important as diet too.\r\n13.03.2022 02:34:54 - Jaiden: Thanks for the tips! I've been trying to incorporate more fruits and veggies.\r\n13.03.2022 02:35:56 - Cindy: That's a good start, Jaiden. Also, try to cut down on processed foods.\r\n13.03.2022 02:36:50 - Tre: Yes, and don't forget about your protein intake. It's essential for muscle health.\r\n13.03.2022 02:38:10 - John: Good point, Tre. Protein is also important for repairing body tissues.\r\n13.03.2022 02:39:10 - Jaiden: I'll keep that in mind! I've also been considering taking supplements.\r\n13.03.2022 02:40:35 - Cindy: It's better to get your nutrients from food, but supplements can help fill the gaps.\r\n13.03.2022 02:41:36 - Tre: Just make sure to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplements.\r\n13.03.2022 02:42:19 - John: Agreed. Not all supplements are created equal, and some can even be harmful.\r\n13.03.2022 04:26:03 - Jaiden: Anyone else notice how hot it's been this week?\r\n13.03.2022 04:27:02 - Cindy: Yes! It's been unbearable. My AC has been running nonstop.\r\n13.03.2022 04:28:11 - Tre: I actually love the heat. It's perfect for my morning runs.\r\n13.03.2022 04:29:28 - John: I'm more of a cool weather guy myself. The heat just drains me.\r\n13.03.2022 04:31:06 - Jaiden: I heard it's supposed to cool down by the weekend.\r\n13.03.2022 04:32:45 - Cindy: That would be a relief. I can't handle another scorcher.\r\n13.03.2022 04:33:54 - Tre: Well, I'm hoping for at least one more hot day. Perfect beach weather.\r\n13.03.2022 04:35:15 - John: Just remember to stay hydrated, everyone. It's easy to forget in this heat.\r\n13.03.2022 09:10:28 - Jaiden: Hey guys, just wondering, what's everyone's major?\r\n13.03.2022 09:12:22 - Cindy: I'm studying Computer Science.

We should study together sometime.\r\n13.03.2022 09:19:58 - John: Definitely, Cindy. It would be great to have a study partner.\r\n13.03.2022 09:21:49 - Tre: Jaiden, what made you choose Business Administration?\r\n13.03.2022 09:23:36 - Jaiden: I've always been interested in running my own business someday. So I thought this would be the best path.\r\n13.03.2022 09:24:13 - Cindy: That sounds like a great plan, Jaiden.\r\n13.03.2022 09:25:45 - John: I agree. It's important to follow our passions.\r\n13.03.2022 09:26:21 - Tre: Absolutely. We're all on our individual paths, but it's nice we can share the journey.\r\n13.03.2022 09:27:57 - Jaiden: Couldn't agree more, guys. Let's all do our best!\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

Any tips?\r\n12.03.2022 18:33:17 - John: I found watching some tutorial videos really helpful, Tre. Try that.\r\n12.03.2022 18:34:46 - Cindy: Also, always remember to use a stiff brush and very little paint for dry brushing.\r\n12.03.2022 18:35:21 - Jaiden: Great tips, guys! Let's keep practicing and share our artworks next week.\r\n12.03.2022 18:35:55 - John: Sounds like a plan. Looking forward to it.\r\n12.03.2022 18:37:06 - Tre: Me too. Happy painting, everyone!\r\n13.03.2022 00:10:18 - Jaiden: Hey guys, what are your plans for this weekend?\r\n13.03.2022 00:11:45 - Cindy: I'm thinking of going to the beach. Anyone wants to join?\r\n13.03.2022 00:13:43 - Tre: Sounds great, Cindy! I'll bring the snacks.\r\n13.03.2022 00:14:22 - John: I'm in too. I'll drive.\r\n13.03.2022 00:15:26 - Jaiden: Awesome! I'll bring the beach games.\r\n13.03.2022 00:16:51 - Cindy: Great. Let's meet at my place at 9 am.\r\n13.03.2022 00:17:54 - Tre: Perfect. See you all there.\r\n13.03.2022 00:18:34 - John: Looking forward to it.\r\n13.03.2022 00:19:23 - Jaiden: It's a date then. See you all on Saturday.\r\n13.03.2022 02:29:45 - Jaiden: Hey guys, I've started a new diet recently, any tips?\r\n13.03.2022 02:30:27 - Cindy: That's great Jaiden! Make sure you're eating a balanced diet, not just restricting certain food groups.\r\n13.03.2022 02:31:45 - Tre: Agreed with Cindy. Also, remember to drink lots of water.\r\n13.03.2022 02:33:08 - John: Absolutely! Exercise is just as important as diet too.\r\n13.03.2022 02:34:54 - Jaiden: Thanks for the tips! I've been trying to incorporate more fruits and veggies.\r\n13.03.2022 02:35:56 - Cindy: That's a good start, Jaiden. Also, try to cut down on processed foods.\r\n13.03.2022 02:36:50 - Tre: Yes, and don't forget about your protein intake. It's essential for muscle health.\r\n13.03.2022 02:38:10 - John: Good point, Tre. Protein is also important for repairing body tissues.\r\n13.03.2022 02:39:10 - Jaiden: I'll keep that in mind! I've also been considering taking supplements.\r\n13.03.2022 02:40:35 - Cindy: It's better to get your nutrients from food, but supplements can help fill the gaps.\r\n13.03.2022 02:41:36 - Tre: Just make sure to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplements.\r\n13.03.2022 02:42:19 - John: Agreed. Not all supplements are created equal, and some can even be harmful.\r\n13.03.2022 04:26:03 - Jaiden: Anyone else notice how hot it's been this week?\r\n13.03.2022 04:27:02 - Cindy: Yes! It's been unbearable. My AC has been running nonstop.\r\n13.03.2022 04:28:11 - Tre: I actually love the heat. It's perfect for my morning runs.\r\n13.03.2022 04:29:28 - John: I'm more of a cool weather guy myself. The heat just drains me.\r\n13.03.2022 04:31:06 - Jaiden: I heard it's supposed to cool down by the weekend.\r\n13.03.2022 04:32:45 - Cindy: That would be a relief. I can't handle another scorcher.\r\n13.03.2022 04:33:54 - Tre: Well, I'm hoping for at least one more hot day. Perfect beach weather.\r\n13.03.2022 04:35:15 - John: Just remember to stay hydrated, everyone. It's easy to forget in this heat.\r\n13.03.2022 09:10:28 - Jaiden: Hey guys, just wondering, what's everyone's major?\r\n13.03.2022 09:12:22 - Cindy: I'm studying Computer Science. How about you Jaiden?\r\n13.03.2022 09:13:04 - Jaiden: I'm in Business Administration. Tre, John, what about you guys?\r\n13.03.2022 09:14:46 - Tre: I'm majoring in Psychology.\r\n13.03.2022 09:16:38 - John: I'm in the same boat as Cindy, Computer Science.\r\n13.03.2022 09:18:32 - Cindy: That's cool John! We should study together sometime.\r\n13.03.2022 09:19:58 - John: Definitely, Cindy. It would be great to have a study partner.\r\n13.03.2022 09:21:49 - Tre: Jaiden, what made you choose Business Administration?\r\n13.03.2022 09:23:36 - Jaiden: I've always been interested in running my own business someday. So I thought this would be the best path.\r\n13.03.2022 09:24:13 - Cindy: That sounds like a great plan, Jaiden.\r\n13.03.2022 09:25:45 - John: I agree. It's important to follow our passions.\r\n13.03.2022 09:26:21 - Tre: Absolutely. We're all on our individual paths, but it's nice we can share the journey.\r\n13.03.2022 09:27:57 - Jaiden: Couldn't agree more, guys.

It's essential for muscle health.\r\n13.03.2022 02:38:10 - John: Good point, Tre. Protein is also important for repairing body tissues.\r\n13.03.2022 02:39:10 - Jaiden: I'll keep that in mind! I've also been considering taking supplements.\r\n13.03.2022 02:40:35 - Cindy: It's better to get your nutrients from food, but supplements can help fill the gaps.\r\n13.03.2022 02:41:36 - Tre: Just make sure to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplements.\r\n13.03.2022 02:42:19 - John: Agreed. Not all supplements are created equal, and some can even be harmful.\r\n13.03.2022 04:26:03 - Jaiden: Anyone else notice how hot it's been this week?\r\n13.03.2022 04:27:02 - Cindy: Yes! It's been unbearable. My AC has been running nonstop.\r\n13.03.2022 04:28:11 - Tre: I actually love the heat. It's perfect for my morning runs.\r\n13.03.2022 04:29:28 - John: I'm more of a cool weather guy myself. The heat just drains me.\r\n13.03.2022 04:31:06 - Jaiden: I heard it's supposed to cool down by the weekend.\r\n13.03.2022 04:32:45 - Cindy: That would be a relief. I can't handle another scorcher.\r\n13.03.2022 04:33:54 - Tre: Well, I'm hoping for at least one more hot day. Perfect beach weather.\r\n13.03.2022 04:35:15 - John: Just remember to stay hydrated, everyone. It's easy to forget in this heat.\r\n13.03.2022 09:10:28 - Jaiden: Hey guys, just wondering, what's everyone's major?\r\n13.03.2022 09:12:22 - Cindy: I'm studying Computer Science. How about you Jaiden?\r\n13.03.2022 09:13:04 - Jaiden: I'm in Business Administration. Tre, John, what about you guys?\r\n13.03.2022 09:14:46 - Tre: I'm majoring in Psychology.\r\n13.03.2022 09:16:38 - John: I'm in the same boat as Cindy, Computer Science.\r\n13.03.2022 09:18:32 - Cindy: That's cool John! We should study together sometime.\r\n13.03.2022 09:19:58 - John: Definitely, Cindy. It would be great to have a study partner.\r\n13.03.2022 09:21:49 - Tre: Jaiden, what made you choose Business Administration?\r\n13.03.2022 09:23:36 - Jaiden: I've always been interested in running my own business someday. So I thought this would be the best path.\r\n13.03.2022 09:24:13 - Cindy: That sounds like a great plan, Jaiden.\r\n13.03.2022 09:25:45 - John: I agree. It's important to follow our passions.\r\n13.03.2022 09:26:21 - Tre: Absolutely. We're all on our individual paths, but it's nice we can share the journey.\r\n13.03.2022 09:27:57 - Jaiden: Couldn't agree more, guys.

How about you?\r\n14.10.2021 16:21:28 - Willie: I'm well, thanks. I was wondering if you've picked up any new hobbies lately.\r\n14.10.2021 16:22:50 - Mary: Actually, yes. I've started painting recently. How about you?\r\n14.10.2021 16:23:32 - Willie: That's cool. I've always admired people who can paint. I've started gardening.\r\n14.10.2021 16:24:21 - Mary: That's interesting. What kind of plants are you growing?\r\n14.10.2021 16:25:55 - Willie: Mainly vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers. It's been really rewarding.\r\n14.10.2021 16:27:09 - Mary: Sounds fun. I've been thinking of starting a small herb garden myself.\r\n14.10.2021 16:27:49 - Willie: I'd highly recommend it. I can help you get started if you want.\r\n14.10.2021 16:28:44 - Mary: That would be great, Willie. Thanks.\r\n14.10.2021 16:29:59 - Willie: You're welcome, Mary. Looking forward to it.\r\n14.10.2021 19:59:03 - Willie: Hey Mary, have you heard the latest album by The Weeknd?\r\n14.10.2021 20:00:50 - Mary: Hey Willie, yes I did. I think it's pretty cool. What about you?\r\n14.10.2021 20:01:36 - Willie: I totally agree, it's different but I like it. Any particular track you like?\r\n14.10.2021 20:02:57 - Mary: Hmm, I really like 'Save Your Tears'. It's catchy.\r\n14.10.2021 20:04:48 - Willie: Yeah, that's a good one! I also like 'Blinding Lights'.\r\n14.10.2021 20:05:44 - Mary: Oh, definitely! That's a classic. It's been on the radio nonstop.\r\n14.10.2021 20:06:19 - Willie: True, it's been quite popular. Do you play any instruments, by the way?\r\n14.10.2021 20:08:12 - Mary: Yes, I play the piano. I'm trying to learn 'Blinding Lights' on it.\r\n14.10.2021 20:10:02 - Willie: That's awesome! Would love to hear it once you've mastered it.\r\n14.10.2021 20:11:35 - Mary: Sure thing, Willie. I'll let you know when I'm ready.\r\n14.10.2021 21:53:11 - Willie: Hi Mary, have you ever pondered over the concept of existentialism?\r\n14.10.2021 21:54:14 - Mary: Hi Willie, indeed. It's quite an intriguing concept. It's the idea that individuals are free and responsible for their own choices and actions, right?\r\n14.10.2021 21:54:50 - Willie: Exactly, Mary. It emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and subjectivity.\r\n14.10.2021 21:55:34 - Mary: But don't you think it can lead to a sense of isolation or despair, considering the emphasis on individual freedom and the lack of external forces?\r\n14.10.2021 21:56:22 - Willie: That's a valid point, Mary. However, it also gives the individual the freedom to define their own purpose in life.\r\n14.10.2021 21:57:28 - Mary: True, Willie. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. A balance between individual freedom and understanding the consequences of our choices.\r\n14.10.2021 21:59:05 - Willie: Well said, Mary. I think that's the crux of existentialism - understanding that freedom comes with responsibility.\r\n14.10.2021 22:00:48 - Mary: Indeed, Willie. It's a fascinating topic to ponder on.\r\n15.10.2021 02:04:41 - Willie: Hey Mary, just checking in about the Johnson project.\r\n15.10.2021 02:06:08 - Mary: Hi Willie, yes I've been working on it. There's a bit of a snag with the data analysis.\r\n15.10.2021 02:07:18 - Willie: Oh, what's the issue?\r\n15.10.2021 02:09:02 - Mary: The data isn't correlating as expected. I might need some assistance.\r\n15.10.2021 02:11:01 - Willie: Alright, I can get Tom from data science to help out. He's great with these kind of problems.\r\n15.10.2021 02:12:53 - Mary: That would be awesome. I've been stuck for a while.\r\n15.10.2021 02:14:19 - Willie: No problem, I'll set up a meeting for tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2021 02:15:06 - Mary: Thanks Willie, really appreciate it.\r\n15.10.2021 02:16:50 - Willie: Not a problem, Mary. We're a team.\r\n15.10.2021 02:17:22 - Mary: Indeed we are. Catch you tomorrow, then.\r\n15.10.2021 02:18:19 - Willie: Yep, catch you tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2021 06:35:17 - Willie: Hey Mary, do you remember the homework for Mr. Johnson's class?\r\n15.10.2021 06:36:08 - Mary: Hi Willie, yes I do. We need to read chapter 5 and answer the questions at the end.\r\n15.10.2021 06:37:13 - Willie: Oh right, thanks! Do you understand the last question?\r\n15.10.2021 06:38:38 - Mary: Yes, it's a bit tricky but it's about the main ideas of the chapter. Do you want me to explain?\r\n15.10.2021 06:40:24 - Willie: Yes please, I'm a bit confused.\r\n15.10.2021 06:42:24 - Mary: No problem! So the main idea is...\r\n15.10.2021 06:43:33 - Willie: Got it, thanks so much Mary!\r\n15.10.2021 06:44:51 - Mary: You're welcome Willie, happy to help!

Have you seen the new video from TED Talks?\r\n14.10.2021 14:53:30 - Willie: No, not yet. What's it about?\r\n14.10.2021 14:54:25 - Mary: It's about the impact of online videos on education. Very insightful.\r\n14.10.2021 14:55:15 - Willie: Sounds interesting. I'll watch it later tonight.\r\n14.10.2021 14:56:57 - Mary: Great!

Have a good night!\r\n14.10.2021 15:01:07 - Willie: You too, Mary. Goodnight!\r\n14.10.2021 16:19:04 - Willie: Hi Mary, hope you're doing well.\r\n14.10.2021 16:20:09 - Mary: Hey Willie, I'm good. How about you?\r\n14.10.2021 16:21:28 - Willie: I'm well, thanks. I was wondering if you've picked up any new hobbies lately.\r\n14.10.2021 16:22:50 - Mary: Actually, yes. I've started painting recently. How about you?\r\n14.10.2021 16:23:32 - Willie: That's cool. I've always admired people who can paint. I've started gardening.\r\n14.10.2021 16:24:21 - Mary: That's interesting. What kind of plants are you growing?\r\n14.10.2021 16:25:55 - Willie: Mainly vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers. It's been really rewarding.\r\n14.10.2021 16:27:09 - Mary: Sounds fun. I've been thinking of starting a small herb garden myself.\r\n14.10.2021 16:27:49 - Willie: I'd highly recommend it. I can help you get started if you want.\r\n14.10.2021 16:28:44 - Mary: That would be great, Willie. Thanks.\r\n14.10.2021 16:29:59 - Willie: You're welcome, Mary. Looking forward to it.\r\n14.10.2021 19:59:03 - Willie: Hey Mary, have you heard the latest album by The Weeknd?\r\n14.10.2021 20:00:50 - Mary: Hey Willie, yes I did. I think it's pretty cool. What about you?\r\n14.10.2021 20:01:36 - Willie: I totally agree, it's different but I like it. Any particular track you like?\r\n14.10.2021 20:02:57 - Mary: Hmm, I really like 'Save Your Tears'. It's catchy.\r\n14.10.2021 20:04:48 - Willie: Yeah, that's a good one! I also like 'Blinding Lights'.\r\n14.10.2021 20:05:44 - Mary: Oh, definitely! That's a classic. It's been on the radio nonstop.\r\n14.10.2021 20:06:19 - Willie: True, it's been quite popular. Do you play any instruments, by the way?\r\n14.10.2021 20:08:12 - Mary: Yes, I play the piano. I'm trying to learn 'Blinding Lights' on it.\r\n14.10.2021 20:10:02 - Willie: That's awesome! Would love to hear it once you've mastered it.\r\n14.10.2021 20:11:35 - Mary: Sure thing, Willie. I'll let you know when I'm ready.\r\n14.10.2021 21:53:11 - Willie: Hi Mary, have you ever pondered over the concept of existentialism?\r\n14.10.2021 21:54:14 - Mary: Hi Willie, indeed. It's quite an intriguing concept. It's the idea that individuals are free and responsible for their own choices and actions, right?\r\n14.10.2021 21:54:50 - Willie: Exactly, Mary. It emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and subjectivity.\r\n14.10.2021 21:55:34 - Mary: But don't you think it can lead to a sense of isolation or despair, considering the emphasis on individual freedom and the lack of external forces?\r\n14.10.2021 21:56:22 - Willie: That's a valid point, Mary. However, it also gives the individual the freedom to define their own purpose in life.\r\n14.10.2021 21:57:28 - Mary: True, Willie. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. A balance between individual freedom and understanding the consequences of our choices.\r\n14.10.2021 21:59:05 - Willie: Well said, Mary. I think that's the crux of existentialism - understanding that freedom comes with responsibility.\r\n14.10.2021 22:00:48 - Mary: Indeed, Willie. It's a fascinating topic to ponder on.\r\n15.10.2021 02:04:41 - Willie: Hey Mary, just checking in about the Johnson project.\r\n15.10.2021 02:06:08 - Mary: Hi Willie, yes I've been working on it. There's a bit of a snag with the data analysis.\r\n15.10.2021 02:07:18 - Willie: Oh, what's the issue?\r\n15.10.2021 02:09:02 - Mary: The data isn't correlating as expected. I might need some assistance.\r\n15.10.2021 02:11:01 - Willie: Alright, I can get Tom from data science to help out. He's great with these kind of problems.\r\n15.10.2021 02:12:53 - Mary: That would be awesome. I've been stuck for a while.\r\n15.10.2021 02:14:19 - Willie: No problem, I'll set up a meeting for tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2021 02:15:06 - Mary: Thanks Willie, really appreciate it.\r\n15.10.2021 02:16:50 - Willie: Not a problem, Mary. We're a team.\r\n15.10.2021 02:17:22 - Mary: Indeed we are. Catch you tomorrow, then.\r\n15.10.2021 02:18:19 - Willie: Yep, catch you tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2021 06:35:17 - Willie: Hey Mary, do you remember the homework for Mr. Johnson's class?\r\n15.10.2021 06:36:08 - Mary: Hi Willie, yes I do. We need to read chapter 5 and answer the questions at the end.\r\n15.10.2021 06:37:13 - Willie: Oh right, thanks! Do you understand the last question?\r\n15.10.2021 06:38:38 - Mary: Yes, it's a bit tricky but it's about the main ideas of the chapter. Do you want me to explain?\r\n15.10.2021 06:40:24 - Willie: Yes please, I'm a bit confused.\r\n15.10.2021 06:42:24 - Mary: No problem! So the main idea is...\r\n15.10.2021 06:43:33 - Willie: Got it, thanks so much Mary!\r\n15.10.2021 06:44:51 - Mary: You're welcome Willie, happy to help!

Can you grab some on your way?\r\n15.10.2021 10:34:12 - Willie: Sure thing. Anything specific you want?\r\n15.10.2021 10:35:10 - Mary: Some soda and water would be great. Thanks Willie!\r\n15.10.2021 10:36:37 - Willie: No problem. See you in a bit.\r\n15.10.2021 10:37:09 - Mary: See you soon, Willie.

It emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and subjectivity.\r\n14.10.2021 21:55:34 - Mary: But don't you think it can lead to a sense of isolation or despair, considering the emphasis on individual freedom and the lack of external forces?\r\n14.10.2021 21:56:22 - Willie: That's a valid point, Mary. However, it also gives the individual the freedom to define their own purpose in life.\r\n14.10.2021 21:57:28 - Mary: True, Willie. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. A balance between individual freedom and understanding the consequences of our choices.\r\n14.10.2021 21:59:05 - Willie: Well said, Mary. I think that's the crux of existentialism - understanding that freedom comes with responsibility.\r\n14.10.2021 22:00:48 - Mary: Indeed, Willie. It's a fascinating topic to ponder on.\r\n15.10.2021 02:04:41 - Willie: Hey Mary, just checking in about the Johnson project.\r\n15.10.2021 02:06:08 - Mary: Hi Willie, yes I've been working on it. There's a bit of a snag with the data analysis.\r\n15.10.2021 02:07:18 - Willie: Oh, what's the issue?\r\n15.10.2021 02:09:02 - Mary: The data isn't correlating as expected. I might need some assistance.\r\n15.10.2021 02:11:01 - Willie: Alright, I can get Tom from data science to help out. He's great with these kind of problems.\r\n15.10.2021 02:12:53 - Mary: That would be awesome. I've been stuck for a while.\r\n15.10.2021 02:14:19 - Willie: No problem, I'll set up a meeting for tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2021 02:15:06 - Mary: Thanks Willie, really appreciate it.\r\n15.10.2021 02:16:50 - Willie: Not a problem, Mary. We're a team.\r\n15.10.2021 02:17:22 - Mary: Indeed we are. Catch you tomorrow, then.\r\n15.10.2021 02:18:19 - Willie: Yep, catch you tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2021 06:35:17 - Willie: Hey Mary, do you remember the homework for Mr. Johnson's class?\r\n15.10.2021 06:36:08 - Mary: Hi Willie, yes I do. We need to read chapter 5 and answer the questions at the end.\r\n15.10.2021 06:37:13 - Willie: Oh right, thanks! Do you understand the last question?\r\n15.10.2021 06:38:38 - Mary: Yes, it's a bit tricky but it's about the main ideas of the chapter. Do you want me to explain?\r\n15.10.2021 06:40:24 - Willie: Yes please, I'm a bit confused.\r\n15.10.2021 06:42:24 - Mary: No problem! So the main idea is...\r\n15.10.2021 06:43:33 - Willie: Got it, thanks so much Mary!\r\n15.10.2021 06:44:51 - Mary: You're welcome Willie, happy to help! Let's ace this assignment!\r\n15.10.2021 10:30:00 - Willie: Hey Mary, are you at the park for the picnic?\r\n15.10.2021 10:30:48 - Mary: Hi Willie, yes I just got here. The place is packed!\r\n15.10.2021 10:31:47 - Willie: Great! I'm on my way. What can I bring?\r\n15.10.2021 10:32:44 - Mary: We could use some more drinks. Can you grab some on your way?\r\n15.10.2021 10:34:12 - Willie: Sure thing. Anything specific you want?\r\n15.10.2021 10:35:10 - Mary: Some soda and water would be great. Thanks Willie!\r\n15.10.2021 10:36:37 - Willie: No problem. See you in a bit.\r\n15.10.2021 10:37:09 - Mary: See you soon, Willie.

It's about a woman who grows up in a strict and abusive household but eventually goes to college, right?\r\n09.04.2022 09:50:08 - Kathleen: Yes, that's the one. It's a very powerful story about the importance of education and the lengths one can go to achieve it.\r\n09.04.2022 09:51:51 - Joy: That sounds interesting. I'll add it to my list. Jayden, any recommendations from you?\r\n09.04.2022 09:53:33 - Jayden: Sure, if you're into fantasy, I'd recommend 'The Name of the Wind'.

Looking forward to it!\r\n09.04.2022 02:10:58 - Jayden: Hey guys, have you started applying for colleges yet?\r\n09.04.2022 02:12:09 - Joy: No, I'm still deciding between a few. How about you, Kathleen?\r\n09.04.2022 02:12:57 - Kathleen: Same here, Joy. There are so many options, it's overwhelming.\r\n09.04.2022 02:14:29 - Jayden: I know right! I'm leaning towards a smaller college, less stress I guess.\r\n09.04.2022 02:15:00 - Joy: That's a good point, Jayden. But what about the opportunities at larger colleges?\r\n09.04.2022 02:16:27 - Kathleen: I think both have their pros and cons. It ultimately depends on what you want from your college experience.\r\n09.04.2022 02:18:10 - Jayden: True. I'm looking for a balance between academics and social life.\r\n09.04.2022 02:20:04 - Joy: That makes sense. I guess it's important to consider all factors before making a decision.\r\n09.04.2022 02:21:55 - Kathleen: Absolutely. Let's take our time and make the right choice.\r\n09.04.2022 04:12:21 - Jayden: Hey guys, have you watched the latest episode of 'Stranger Things'?\r\n09.04.2022 04:13:40 - Joy: Not yet, Jayden! No spoilers, please. I plan to watch it tonight.\r\n09.04.2022 04:14:23 - Jayden: Absolutely, no spoilers! But you're in for a treat.\r\n09.04.2022 04:16:11 - Kathleen: I watched it! It's mind-blowing. The storyline is getting intriguing.\r\n09.04.2022 04:17:17 - Joy: Now, I can't wait to watch it. Any more recommendations, guys?\r\n09.04.2022 04:18:15 - Jayden: Have you guys checked 'The Crown'? It's a great historical drama.\r\n09.04.2022 04:19:45 - Kathleen: I love 'The Crown'! The acting and the depiction of the royal family is incredible.\r\n09.04.2022 04:21:23 - Joy: I've heard about it but never got around to watching it. I'll add it to my list.\r\n09.04.2022 04:23:05 - Jayden: Do that, Joy. You won't regret it. Also, 'Breaking Bad' is a must-watch if you haven't seen it.\r\n09.04.2022 04:24:52 - Kathleen: Breaking Bad is legendary. Walter White is one of the most complex characters ever.\r\n09.04.2022 04:25:28 - Joy: Alright, 'The Crown' and 'Breaking Bad' added to my list. Thanks for the suggestions, guys!\r\n09.04.2022 04:25:59 - Jayden: Anytime, Joy.

It's a psychological thriller and it's really good!\r\n09.04.2022 09:47:55 - Kathleen: I've been reading a lot of non-fiction. I just finished 'Educated' by Tara Westover.\r\n09.04.2022 09:48:56 - Jayden: Oh, I've heard about 'Educated'. It's about a woman who grows up in a strict and abusive household but eventually goes to college, right?\r\n09.04.2022 09:50:08 - Kathleen: Yes, that's the one. It's a very powerful story about the importance of education and the lengths one can go to achieve it.\r\n09.04.2022 09:51:51 - Joy: That sounds interesting. I'll add it to my list. Jayden, any recommendations from you?\r\n09.04.2022 09:53:33 - Jayden: Sure, if you're into fantasy, I'd recommend 'The Name of the Wind'. It's the first book in a trilogy.\r\n09.04.2022 09:54:05 - Joy: I love fantasy! I'll definitely check it out. Kathleen, any other books you'd recommend?\r\n09.04.2022 09:55:38 - Kathleen: If you're interested in history, 'Sapiens' is a great read. It's about the history of humankind.\r\n09.04.2022 09:56:27 - Jayden: Sounds intriguing. I'll add it to my list. Thanks for the recommendations, guys.\r\n09.04.2022 09:58:04 - Joy: No problem, happy reading!\r\n09.04.2022 09:59:23 - Kathleen: Same to you both.

What kind of music do they play?\r\n20.04.2022 13:55:54 - Paul: They're a synthwave band. Their music is kind of a mix between 80's electronic and modern pop.\r\n20.04.2022 13:57:51 - Amelia: Sounds interesting! Any song recommendations?\r\n20.04.2022 13:59:48 - Paul: Definitely! Try 'Los Angeles', 'Sunset' and 'Vampires'. The first one is my favorite.\r\n20.04.2022 14:01:15 - Amelia: I'll give them a listen. I've been looking for some new music to add to my playlist.\r\n20.04.2022 14:01:49 - Paul: Great! Let me know what you think.

No spoilers, please!\r\n20.04.2022 15:38:09 - Paul: Trust me, you'll love it. Have you been keeping up with other shows?\r\n20.04.2022 15:38:45 - Amelia: I've been watching The Crown lately. It's quite interesting.\r\n20.04.2022 15:40:03 - Paul: Oh yeah? I've heard good things about it. Worth a watch?\r\n20.04.2022 15:41:42 - Amelia: Definitely!

Who's playing in the soccer game?\r\n20.04.2022 18:33:03 - Paul: It's Manchester United vs Barcelona. It's going to be a thrilling match!\r\n20.04.2022 18:34:15 - Amelia: Sounds exciting, but I'm a huge Lakers fan and they're playing tonight as well.\r\n20.04.2022 18:36:05 - Paul: Oh that's cool! Maybe we can keep each other updated on the scores?\r\n20.04.2022 18:37:19 - Amelia: Sure, that sounds like a fun idea. Let's do it!\r\n20.04.2022 18:38:12 - Paul: Great! I'll message you once the soccer game starts.\r\n20.04.2022 18:39:53 - Amelia: And I'll do the same for the basketball game.

We named her Bella.\r\n20.04.2022 21:55:50 - Paul: That's a cute name. How are you finding the experience of training her?\r\n20.04.2022 21:56:24 - Amelia: It's not easy, but it's rewarding. She's slowly learning commands.\r\n20.04.2022 21:56:57 - Paul: That's good to hear. I'm thinking of getting a cat, any advice?\r\n20.04.2022 21:57:41 - Amelia: Oh, that's exciting! Cats are more independent, but make sure to give them plenty of attention too.\r\n20.04.2022 21:58:46 - Paul: I'll keep that in mind. How about feeding, is it different from dogs?\r\n20.04.2022 22:00:33 - Amelia: Yes, they have different dietary needs. I would recommend doing some research or asking a vet.\r\n20.04.2022 22:02:06 - Paul: Will do. Thanks for the advice, Amelia.\r\n20.04.2022 22:02:52 - Amelia: No problem, Paul.

I find their music really refreshing.\r\n20.04.2022 14:02:53 - Amelia: Will do. Thanks for the recommendation, Paul!\r\n20.04.2022 14:03:53 - Paul: Anytime, Amelia. Always happy to share good music!\r\n20.04.2022 14:05:53 - Amelia: Just listened to 'Los Angeles'. I love it! Can't wait to explore more of their songs.\r\n20.04.2022 15:34:26 - Paul: Hey Amelia, have you seen the new episode of Stranger Things?\r\n20.04.2022 15:35:05 - Amelia: Hi Paul, no I haven't. Is it good?\r\n20.04.2022 15:36:15 - Paul: It's amazing! The plot twist was totally unexpected.\r\n20.04.2022 15:37:01 - Amelia: Wow! Now I'm intrigued. No spoilers, please!\r\n20.04.2022 15:38:09 - Paul: Trust me, you'll love it. Have you been keeping up with other shows?\r\n20.04.2022 15:38:45 - Amelia: I've been watching The Crown lately. It's quite interesting.\r\n20.04.2022 15:40:03 - Paul: Oh yeah? I've heard good things about it. Worth a watch?\r\n20.04.2022 15:41:42 - Amelia: Definitely! The performances are top notch.\r\n20.04.2022 15:42:26 - Paul: I'll definitely check it out then. Any other recommendations?\r\n20.04.2022 15:43:50 - Amelia: If you're into thrillers, you should definitely watch Money Heist.\r\n20.04.2022 15:45:09 - Paul: Thanks! I'll add that to my list.\r\n20.04.2022 18:30:00 - Paul: Hi Amelia, are you watching the soccer game tonight?\r\n20.04.2022 18:31:35 - Amelia: Hey Paul, I was actually planning to watch the basketball game. Who's playing in the soccer game?\r\n20.04.2022 18:33:03 - Paul: It's Manchester United vs Barcelona. It's going to be a thrilling match!\r\n20.04.2022 18:34:15 - Amelia: Sounds exciting, but I'm a huge Lakers fan and they're playing tonight as well.\r\n20.04.2022 18:36:05 - Paul: Oh that's cool! Maybe we can keep each other updated on the scores?\r\n20.04.2022 18:37:19 - Amelia: Sure, that sounds like a fun idea. Let's do it!\r\n20.04.2022 18:38:12 - Paul: Great! I'll message you once the soccer game starts.\r\n20.04.2022 18:39:53 - Amelia: And I'll do the same for the basketball game. Looking forward to our sports night!\r\n20.04.2022 18:40:31 - Paul: Absolutely! It will be fun to follow both games at the same time.\r\n20.04.2022 18:42:14 - Amelia: Agreed, it's a date then. Talk to you later, Paul!\r\n20.04.2022 18:43:34 - Paul: Talk to you later, Amelia. Enjoy the game!\r\n20.04.2022 21:53:21 - Paul: Hey Amelia, how's your new puppy doing?\r\n20.04.2022 21:54:33 - Amelia: Hi Paul, she's doing great. We named her Bella.\r\n20.04.2022 21:55:50 - Paul: That's a cute name. How are you finding the experience of training her?\r\n20.04.2022 21:56:24 - Amelia: It's not easy, but it's rewarding. She's slowly learning commands.\r\n20.04.2022 21:56:57 - Paul: That's good to hear. I'm thinking of getting a cat, any advice?\r\n20.04.2022 21:57:41 - Amelia: Oh, that's exciting! Cats are more independent, but make sure to give them plenty of attention too.\r\n20.04.2022 21:58:46 - Paul: I'll keep that in mind. How about feeding, is it different from dogs?\r\n20.04.2022 22:00:33 - Amelia: Yes, they have different dietary needs. I would recommend doing some research or asking a vet.\r\n20.04.2022 22:02:06 - Paul: Will do. Thanks for the advice, Amelia.\r\n20.04.2022 22:02:52 - Amelia: No problem, Paul. I'm sure you'll be a great cat owner.\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

That was quite a match.\r\n15.05.2022 18:31:34 - Evelyn: I missed it. What happened?\r\n15.05.2022 18:33:02 - Mason: Our team scored 3 goals in the second half. It was amazing.\r\n15.05.2022 18:34:46 - Glen: Yeah, it was. The other team couldn't even touch the ball.\r\n15.05.2022 18:35:44 - Evelyn: Wow! Sounds like it was an exciting game. I'll watch the highlights.\r\n15.05.2022 18:37:32 - Mason: You should, Evelyn. It was one of the best games this season.\r\n15.05.2022 18:38:25 - Glen: Agreed.

What was it about, Mason?\r\n15.05.2022 23:51:23 - Mason: I was floating in space, surrounded by stars. It was incredibly peaceful.\r\n15.05.2022 23:52:51 - Evelyn: That's so interesting, Mason!

Not nearly as exciting.\r\n15.05.2022 23:56:12 - Mason: Glen, even ordinary dreams can have interesting interpretations.\r\n15.05.2022 23:58:03 - Evelyn: Mason's right, Glen. For example, dreaming about work often means you're dedicated and ambitious.\r\n15.05.2022 23:59:06 - Glen: That's a comforting interpretation, Evelyn! I'll think about it next time.\r\n15.05.2022 23:59:54 - Mason: Let's all share our dreams more often.

Remember when we used to compete on who gets to eat the last slice of pizza?\r\n15.05.2022 07:14:30 - Evelyn: Oh, I always won that one. Mason, you were always the peacemaker though.\r\n15.05.2022 07:15:27 - Mason: Yeah, I guess I just hated seeing us fight. Plus, more pizza for you, Evelyn.\r\n15.05.2022 07:17:12 - Glen: Mason, you were always the mature one. Remember when Evelyn locked herself in her room because I broke her doll by accident?\r\n15.05.2022 07:19:06 - Evelyn: Oh, don't remind me! I was so mad at you, Glen.\r\n15.05.2022 07:20:53 - Mason: And remember how I managed to pick the lock and get you two to make up?\r\n15.05.2022 07:22:18 - Glen: Yeah, that was legendary. You always knew how to handle situations.\r\n15.05.2022 07:23:23 - Evelyn: Even though we fought, I wouldn't change our childhood for anything.

But I checked on the National Weather Service's website.\r\n15.05.2022 13:12:23 - Evelyn: I see, I checked on Weather.com. Maybe we should look at a few more sources to be sure.\r\n15.05.2022 13:14:04 - Mason: Good idea, Evelyn. I'll check on AccuWeather.\r\n15.05.2022 13:15:43 - Glen: And I'll check on the Weather Channel's site.\r\n15.05.2022 13:17:17 - Evelyn: Let's regroup in an hour with our findings.\r\n15.05.2022 13:19:05 - Mason: Sounds like a plan.

Maybe we could all go this weekend?\r\n15.05.2022 15:26:53 - Glen: I'm free on Sunday. How about you, Evelyn?\r\n15.05.2022 15:28:19 - Evelyn: Sunday works for me.

That panda has better gymnastic skills than me.\r\n20.03.2022 13:47:30 - Kyle: I laughed so hard when it tried to do a somersault but ended up rolling down.\r\n20.03.2022 13:48:27 - Leon: I didn't see it yet.

What breed are you thinking of?\r\n20.03.2022 16:49:31 - Adam: A Golden Retriever, maybe. They seem friendly.\r\n20.03.2022 16:50:09 - Leon: Golden Retrievers are definitely friendly. But they need a lot of exercise.\r\n20.03.2022 16:51:00 - Jessica: That's true, Leon. And they also need a lot of space.\r\n20.03.2022 16:52:47 - Shelby: Maybe a cat would be more suitable, Adam? They're easier to take care of.\r\n20.03.2022 16:53:32 - Kyle: But cats can be quite aloof, Shelby. They're not as affectionate as dogs.\r\n20.03.2022 16:54:46 - Jessica: That's a stereotype, Kyle. My cat is very affectionate.\r\n20.03.2022 16:56:38 - Leon: Maybe we should let Adam decide. It's his pet, after all.\r\n20.03.2022 16:57:26 - Adam: You guys have given me a lot to think about.

I've been following the NBA more closely.\r\n20.03.2022 20:47:53 - Jessica: That's cool, Leon. Who's your favorite team?\r\n20.03.2022 20:49:42 - Leon: Definitely the Lakers.

It's really different from his previous stuff, isn't it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:13 - Thomas: Definitely, he seems to be experimenting with a new sound. What did you think of it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:44 - Kristopher: I quite liked it, but I need to listen to it a few more times to fully appreciate it. The lyrics are quite deep.\r\n14.05.2022 11:08:17 - Thomas: I agree. I think 'Save Your Tears' is my favourite track. What's yours?\r\n14.05.2022 11:09:06 - Kristopher: Hmm, I think 'Blinding Lights' is my favourite. I love the synth in it.\r\n14.05.2022 11:10:27 - Thomas: Yeah, that's a great track too. Have you been to any good concerts lately?\r\n14.05.2022 11:11:10 - Kristopher: Not recently, due to the pandemic. But I'm looking forward to seeing some live music again soon.\r\n14.05.2022 11:12:04 - Thomas: Same here.

Is it any good?\r\n14.05.2022 04:15:31 - Thomas: I think it's amazing! The graphics and gameplay are much better.\r\n14.05.2022 04:16:39 - Kristopher: Sounds good. I've been playing a lot of Fortnite recently.\r\n14.05.2022 04:18:21 - Thomas: I've never really got into Fortnite. I prefer the realism in Call of Duty.\r\n14.05.2022 04:19:25 - Kristopher: Fair enough. Each to their own I guess.\r\n14.05.2022 04:20:18 - Thomas: Exactly. So, are you planning on trying the new Call of Duty?\r\n14.05.2022 04:21:05 - Kristopher: I think I will, especially after hearing your thoughts about it.\r\n14.05.2022 04:22:08 - Thomas: Awesome!

Where will we be meeting?\r\n14.05.2022 09:37:45 - Thomas: I was thinking we could meet at our usual coffee shop.

It's really different from his previous stuff, isn't it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:13 - Thomas: Definitely, he seems to be experimenting with a new sound. What did you think of it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:44 - Kristopher: I quite liked it, but I need to listen to it a few more times to fully appreciate it. The lyrics are quite deep.\r\n14.05.2022 11:08:17 - Thomas: I agree. I think 'Save Your Tears' is my favourite track. What's yours?\r\n14.05.2022 11:09:06 - Kristopher: Hmm, I think 'Blinding Lights' is my favourite. I love the synth in it.\r\n14.05.2022 11:10:27 - Thomas: Yeah, that's a great track too. Have you been to any good concerts lately?\r\n14.05.2022 11:11:10 - Kristopher: Not recently, due to the pandemic. But I'm looking forward to seeing some live music again soon.\r\n14.05.2022 11:12:04 - Thomas: Same here.
