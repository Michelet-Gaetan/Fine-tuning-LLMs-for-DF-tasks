Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama.

Where are you planning to go?\r\n15.10.2022 05:28:06 - Clara: I'm not sure yet, I was thinking about going to Europe. Have you ever been?\r\n15.10.2022 05:29:51 - Carlton: Yes, I've been to France and Italy. Both were great experiences. \r\n15.10.2022 05:30:42 - Clara: I've always wanted to go to France. What was your favorite part?\r\n15.10.2022 05:31:22 - Carlton: The food was incredible! And the art museums in Paris were a highlight.\r\n15.10.2022 05:32:54 - Clara: That sounds amazing. I think I'll start planning my trip to France!\r\n15.10.2022 05:33:59 - Carlton: That's exciting! Make sure to visit the Louvre and take a trip to the countryside.\r\n15.10.2022 05:34:57 - Clara: Definitely, I'll add those to my list. Thanks for the advice, Carlton.\r\n15.10.2022 05:35:54 - Carlton: No problem, Clara. Have a fantastic trip!\r\n15.10.2022 08:20:19 - Clara: Hey Carlton, have you read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' yet?\r\n15.10.2022 08:21:23 - Carlton: Hey Clara! Yes, I finished it last night. It was an incredibly moving read.\r\n15.10.2022 08:23:11 - Clara: I'm glad you enjoyed it. What did you think of Scout as a character?\r\n15.10.2022 08:23:43 - Carlton: I thought Scout was a brilliant character. She provided an innocent and unique perspective to the racial tension in the story.\r\n15.10.2022 08:25:32 - Clara: Exactly! Her innocence made the events even more poignant. Now, what about '1984'? Have you started that?\r\n15.10.2022 08:26:04 - Carlton: Not yet, but it's next on my list. I've heard it's quite a thought-provoking book.\r\n15.10.2022 08:27:04 - Clara: It certainly is. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it. Happy reading!\r\n15.10.2022 08:27:52 - Carlton: Thanks, Clara!

I just finished listening to it. It's pretty amazing, don't you think?\r\n15.10.2022 12:29:46 - Clara: Absolutely! I especially loved the track \"Save Your Tears\". The lyrics are so deep.\r\n15.10.2022 12:31:22 - Carlton: I couldn't agree more. But I'm also really into \"Blinding Lights\". The beat is so catchy.\r\n15.10.2022 12:32:48 - Clara: True that. I've been playing it on repeat. What do you think about the overall theme of the album?\r\n15.10.2022 12:33:47 - Carlton: It seems to me that it's about heartbreak and recovery, with a touch of his usual dark style.\r\n15.10.2022 12:35:18 - Clara: Yes, I also think it's a bit darker than his previous work. But I like it, it's different.\r\n15.10.2022 12:36:09 - Carlton: Definitely. It's always refreshing when artists try something new and it works.\r\n15.10.2022 12:37:12 - Clara: Right. By the way, do you have any other music recommendations?\r\n15.10.2022 12:38:48 - Carlton: If you're into The Weeknd, you might also like Frank Ocean. His music has a similar vibe.\r\n15.10.2022 12:40:10 - Clara: Thanks, Carlton! I'll check him out.\r\n15.10.2022 12:42:10 - Carlton: No problem, Clara. Enjoy!\r\n15.10.2022 14:22:13 - Clara: Hey Carlton, have you seen the recent news about the Mars Rover?\r\n15.10.2022 14:22:43 - Carlton: Yes, Clara! It's fascinating. They've just recently collected a sample from the Martian surface.\r\n15.10.2022 14:24:36 - Clara: Yeah, I read about it. It's such a milestone in space exploration, isn't it?\r\n15.10.2022 14:25:10 - Carlton: Definitely. It's mind-blowing to think that we're now able to collect samples from another planet.\r\n15.10.2022 14:26:38 - Clara: I know, right? And the fact that we might discover signs of past microbial life on Mars!\r\n15.10.2022 14:28:25 - Carlton: It's a huge leap towards answering the age-old question: Are we alone in the universe?\r\n15.10.2022 14:29:02 - Clara: Exactly! It's both exciting and a bit scary at the same time.\r\n15.10.2022 14:30:58 - Carlton: I agree. But it's definitely more exciting. The universe is full of possibilities.\r\n15.10.2022 14:32:17 - Clara: I can't wait to see what they'll discover next.\r\n15.10.2022 14:32:55 - Carlton: Me too. These are exciting times we're living in.\r\n15.10.2022 14:34:54 - Clara: Definitely. Let's keep each other posted on any new updates!\r\n15.10.2022 14:36:25 - Carlton: Deal. It's always fun discussing these things with you, Clara.\r\n15.10.2022 17:17:06 - Clara: Hey Carlton, how are you?\r\n15.10.2022 17:18:11 - Carlton: Hey Clara, I'm doing well. Just a bit stressed about exams.\r\n15.10.2022 17:20:02 - Clara: I can relate, these end of year exams are really nerve-wracking.\r\n15.10.2022 17:20:59 - Carlton: Yeah, especially the physics exam. I am really struggling with that subject.\r\n15.10.2022 17:21:32 - Clara: Have you tried revising with some online resources? There are some good YouTube channels that explain the concepts really well.\r\n15.10.2022 17:22:56 - Carlton: I haven't tried that yet. Could you recommend some channels?\r\n15.10.2022 17:23:39 - Clara: Sure, I'll send you some links. Also, we could study together if you want.\r\n15.10.2022 17:24:46 - Carlton: That would be great. Thanks a lot, Clara.\r\n15.10.2022 17:25:43 - Clara: No problem, Carlton. We can get through this together.\r\n15.10.2022 17:26:55 - Carlton: I appreciate it, Clara. You're a lifesaver.\r\n15.10.2022 18:45:30 - Clara: Hey Carlton, got a minute to discuss our next move?\r\n15.10.2022 18:46:29 - Carlton: Sure, Clara. What's on your mind?\r\n15.10.2022 18:47:42 - Clara: I've been thinking about the museum heist. We need to plan carefully.\r\n15.10.2022 18:48:40 - Carlton: Agreed. Let's start with the security. Any idea what we're dealing with?\r\n15.10.2022 18:49:11 - Clara: They have motion detectors and laser security grids. But, I have a contact who can help us disable it.\r\n15.10.2022 18:50:09 - Carlton: Sounds promising. What about the guards and surveillance cameras?\r\n15.10.2022 18:51:53 - Clara: There are four guards on rotation and cameras at every corner. We might need a distraction.\r\n15.10.2022 18:53:40 - Carlton: I might know just the guy for that. Can we trust your contact though?\r\n15.10.2022 18:54:27 - Clara: Absolutely. She's a pro. But we need to act fast, they're switching security companies soon.\r\n15.10.2022 18:55:01 - Carlton: Alright, let's get everyone together tomorrow and lay out the plan.\r\n15.10.2022 18:56:40 - Clara: Sounds like a plan, Carlton. See you tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2022 21:12:12 - Clara: Hey Carlton, have you started watching the new season of 'Stranger Things' yet?\r\n15.10.2022 21:13:45 - Carlton: Not yet, Clara. I've been busy with work. Is it any good?\r\n15.10.2022 21:15:15 - Clara: I think it's amazing! The plot seems more intense this time. You should really start watching it.\r\n15.10.2022 21:16:04 - Carlton: I've heard mixed reviews about it. Some say it's not as good as the previous seasons.\r\n15.10.2022 21:17:57 - Clara: Well, I think it's subjective. I personally loved it. There are some unexpected twists that make it more interesting.\r\n15.10.2022 21:19:46 - Carlton: Alright, you've convinced me. I'll start watching it this weekend.\r\n15.10.2022 21:20:35 - Clara: Great! We can discuss the episodes once you've seen them.\r\n15.10.2022 21:22:35 - Carlton: Sounds good.

It's always fun discussing these things with you, Clara.\r\n15.10.2022 17:17:06 - Clara: Hey Carlton, how are you?\r\n15.10.2022 17:18:11 - Carlton: Hey Clara, I'm doing well. Just a bit stressed about exams.\r\n15.10.2022 17:20:02 - Clara: I can relate, these end of year exams are really nerve-wracking.\r\n15.10.2022 17:20:59 - Carlton: Yeah, especially the physics exam. I am really struggling with that subject.\r\n15.10.2022 17:21:32 - Clara: Have you tried revising with some online resources? There are some good YouTube channels that explain the concepts really well.\r\n15.10.2022 17:22:56 - Carlton: I haven't tried that yet. Could you recommend some channels?\r\n15.10.2022 17:23:39 - Clara: Sure, I'll send you some links. Also, we could study together if you want.\r\n15.10.2022 17:24:46 - Carlton: That would be great. Thanks a lot, Clara.\r\n15.10.2022 17:25:43 - Clara: No problem, Carlton. We can get through this together.\r\n15.10.2022 17:26:55 - Carlton: I appreciate it, Clara. You're a lifesaver.\r\n15.10.2022 18:45:30 - Clara: Hey Carlton, got a minute to discuss our next move?\r\n15.10.2022 18:46:29 - Carlton: Sure, Clara. What's on your mind?\r\n15.10.2022 18:47:42 - Clara: I've been thinking about the museum heist. We need to plan carefully.\r\n15.10.2022 18:48:40 - Carlton: Agreed. Let's start with the security. Any idea what we're dealing with?\r\n15.10.2022 18:49:11 - Clara: They have motion detectors and laser security grids. But, I have a contact who can help us disable it.\r\n15.10.2022 18:50:09 - Carlton: Sounds promising. What about the guards and surveillance cameras?\r\n15.10.2022 18:51:53 - Clara: There are four guards on rotation and cameras at every corner. We might need a distraction.\r\n15.10.2022 18:53:40 - Carlton: I might know just the guy for that. Can we trust your contact though?\r\n15.10.2022 18:54:27 - Clara: Absolutely. She's a pro. But we need to act fast, they're switching security companies soon.\r\n15.10.2022 18:55:01 - Carlton: Alright, let's get everyone together tomorrow and lay out the plan.\r\n15.10.2022 18:56:40 - Clara: Sounds like a plan, Carlton. See you tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2022 21:12:12 - Clara: Hey Carlton, have you started watching the new season of 'Stranger Things' yet?\r\n15.10.2022 21:13:45 - Carlton: Not yet, Clara. I've been busy with work. Is it any good?\r\n15.10.2022 21:15:15 - Clara: I think it's amazing! The plot seems more intense this time. You should really start watching it.\r\n15.10.2022 21:16:04 - Carlton: I've heard mixed reviews about it. Some say it's not as good as the previous seasons.\r\n15.10.2022 21:17:57 - Clara: Well, I think it's subjective. I personally loved it. There are some unexpected twists that make it more interesting.\r\n15.10.2022 21:19:46 - Carlton: Alright, you've convinced me. I'll start watching it this weekend.\r\n15.10.2022 21:20:35 - Clara: Great! We can discuss the episodes once you've seen them.\r\n15.10.2022 21:22:35 - Carlton: Sounds good.

Where are you planning to go?\r\n15.10.2022 05:28:06 - Clara: I'm not sure yet, I was thinking about going to Europe.

It was an incredibly moving read.\r\n15.10.2022 08:23:11 - Clara: I'm glad you enjoyed it. What did you think of Scout as a character?\r\n15.10.2022 08:23:43 - Carlton: I thought Scout was a brilliant character. She provided an innocent and unique perspective to the racial tension in the story.\r\n15.10.2022 08:25:32 - Clara: Exactly! Her innocence made the events even more poignant. Now, what about '1984'? Have you started that?\r\n15.10.2022 08:26:04 - Carlton: Not yet, but it's next on my list. I've heard it's quite a thought-provoking book.\r\n15.10.2022 08:27:04 - Clara: It certainly is.

I just finished listening to it. It's pretty amazing, don't you think?\r\n15.10.2022 12:29:46 - Clara: Absolutely! I especially loved the track \"Save Your Tears\". The lyrics are so deep.\r\n15.10.2022 12:31:22 - Carlton: I couldn't agree more. But I'm also really into \"Blinding Lights\". The beat is so catchy.\r\n15.10.2022 12:32:48 - Clara: True that. I've been playing it on repeat. What do you think about the overall theme of the album?\r\n15.10.2022 12:33:47 - Carlton: It seems to me that it's about heartbreak and recovery, with a touch of his usual dark style.\r\n15.10.2022 12:35:18 - Clara: Yes, I also think it's a bit darker than his previous work. But I like it, it's different.\r\n15.10.2022 12:36:09 - Carlton: Definitely. It's always refreshing when artists try something new and it works.\r\n15.10.2022 12:37:12 - Clara: Right. By the way, do you have any other music recommendations?\r\n15.10.2022 12:38:48 - Carlton: If you're into The Weeknd, you might also like Frank Ocean. His music has a similar vibe.\r\n15.10.2022 12:40:10 - Clara: Thanks, Carlton! I'll check him out.\r\n15.10.2022 12:42:10 - Carlton: No problem, Clara.

They've just recently collected a sample from the Martian surface.\r\n15.10.2022 14:24:36 - Clara: Yeah, I read about it. It's such a milestone in space exploration, isn't it?\r\n15.10.2022 14:25:10 - Carlton: Definitely. It's mind-blowing to think that we're now able to collect samples from another planet.\r\n15.10.2022 14:26:38 - Clara: I know, right? And the fact that we might discover signs of past microbial life on Mars!\r\n15.10.2022 14:28:25 - Carlton: It's a huge leap towards answering the age-old question: Are we alone in the universe?\r\n15.10.2022 14:29:02 - Clara: Exactly! It's both exciting and a bit scary at the same time.\r\n15.10.2022 14:30:58 - Carlton: I agree. But it's definitely more exciting.

I found it quite enlightening. What did you think, Reba?\r\n20.09.2022 06:29:46 - Reba: I loved it! It really made me think about my personal journey and goals.\r\n20.09.2022 06:31:24 - Ronnie: I haven't read it yet, but I've heard a lot of good things. Would you recommend it, Reba?\r\n20.09.2022 06:32:03 - Reba: Absolutely, Ronnie! I think it's a must-read.\r\n20.09.2022 06:33:17 - Sheree: I've read it too and I can second that. It's a great book.\r\n20.09.2022 06:34:56 - Robert: I'm not much of a reader, but you guys are making me want to pick it up!\r\n20.09.2022 06:36:32 - Nadir: You should, Robert. It's quite a short read but very profound.\r\n20.09.2022 06:37:13 - Ronnie: I'll definitely add it to my reading list then!\r\n20.09.2022 06:38:05 - Sheree: Same here, Ronnie. It's been a while since I read a good book.\r\n20.09.2022 06:38:53 - Reba: That's great to hear, guys! I can't wait to hear your thoughts on it.\r\n20.09.2022 06:40:24 - Robert: Alright, I'm convinced. I'll buy it this weekend.\r\n20.09.2022 06:41:50 - Nadir: Looking forward to our next book discussion then!\r\n20.09.2022 06:43:49 - Ronnie: Me too! Thanks for the recommendation, Reba and Nadir.\r\n20.09.2022 06:45:23 - Reba: You're welcome, Ronnie! Happy reading everyone!\r\n20.09.2022 09:14:45 - Reba: Hey guys, have you tried the new update of 'Breath of the Wild' yet?\r\n20.09.2022 09:16:43 - Nadir: Not yet, Reba. I've been hooked on 'Among Us'. Anyone else playing?\r\n20.09.2022 09:18:43 - Ronnie: I am, Nadir! It's a great game for strategy. We should get a group together for it.\r\n20.09.2022 09:20:22 - Sheree: Count me in! I love 'Among Us'. I usually play on the 'Polus' map.\r\n20.09.2022 09:22:20 - Robert: Same here. It's great fun. Let's set up a time this weekend?\r\n20.09.2022 09:23:09 - Nadir: Sounds like a plan. I'll set up a group chat for us to coordinate.\r\n20.09.2022 09:25:09 - Reba: Great! Looking forward to it.\r\n20.09.2022 09:26:03 - Ronnie: Me too. It's been a while since we had a group game.\r\n20.09.2022 09:26:49 - Sheree: Can't wait! See you guys in the game.\r\n20.09.2022 09:28:13 - Robert: Sounds good. See you guys then.\r\n20.09.2022 12:23:37 - Reba: Hello everyone, have you seen the latest news on climate change?\r\n20.09.2022 12:25:01 - Nadir: Yes, I just read an article about it. The situation is becoming more critical.\r\n20.09.2022 12:25:32 - Ronnie: I agree, Nadir. It's alarming how rapidly the Arctic ice is melting.\r\n20.09.2022 12:26:41 - Sheree: Not just the Arctic, even our local weather patterns have been so unpredictable lately.\r\n20.09.2022 12:28:41 - Robert: True Sheree, it's high time we start taking some serious action.\r\n20.09.2022 12:30:38 - Reba: I was thinking the same. Maybe we should start by minimizing our carbon footprint.\r\n20.09.2022 12:31:17 - Nadir: That's a good start, Reba. We should also encourage others to do the same.\r\n20.09.2022 12:31:58 - Ronnie: Agreed. Also, awareness about the situation is crucial. Many people are still unaware of the gravity of the situation.\r\n20.09.2022 12:33:19 - Sheree: That's right Ronnie. More awareness campaigns are needed.\r\n20.09.2022 12:35:13 - Robert: Let's each do our part and hope for the best.\r\n20.09.2022 16:30:57 - Reba: Hey guys, I've been thinking about our next group adventure. Any thoughts?\r\n20.09.2022 16:32:33 - Nadir: Great idea, Reba! I think we should visit somewhere exotic.\r\n20.09.2022 16:34:12 - Ronnie: What about a safari trip to Africa? I've heard it's a unique experience.\r\n20.09.2022 16:35:09 - Sheree: That sounds awesome, Ronnie. But we also need to consider the budget.\r\n20.09.2022 16:36:37 - Robert: How about backpacking across Europe? It's affordable and we can explore different cultures.\r\n20.09.2022 16:37:54 - Reba: I love the idea, Robert! We could start from Spain and make our way to Greece.\r\n20.09.2022 16:39:13 - Nadir: Sounds like a plan! We should make a list of must-visit places and things to do.\r\n20.09.2022 16:40:53 - Ronnie: Absolutely, Nadir. Also, we need to check the best time to visit these countries.\r\n20.09.2022 16:42:48 - Sheree: Yes, and let's not forget about food. We must try local cuisines in each country.\r\n20.09.2022 16:44:24 - Robert: Agreed, Sheree. I can't wait to try some authentic pizza in Italy.\r\n20.09.2022 16:45:46 - Reba: Sounds like we have a plan, guys. Let's start preparing for our European adventure.\r\n20.09.2022 18:30:00 - Reba: Alright team, we have a new job. The target is the National Museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:31:29 - Nadir: Sounds risky, Reba. What's the prize?\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:28 - Reba: A priceless artifact, The Heart of the Ocean. It's worth the risk.\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:58 - Ronnie: I'm in. I can handle the security systems.\r\n20.09.2022 18:35:48 - Sheree: I'll get us the blueprints of the museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:37:15 - Robert: And I can arrange our getaway vehicle.\r\n20.09.2022 18:38:21 - Reba: Excellent. Everyone knows their role. Let's meet at the usual spot tomorrow to iron out the details.\r\n20.09.2022 18:39:48 - Nadir: I've got a feeling this is going to be a big one.\r\n20.09.2022 18:40:54 - Ronnie: Just another day at the office, Nadir.\r\n20.09.2022 18:41:48 - Sheree: Blueprints are in hand. This place is a maze.\r\n20.09.2022 18:42:49 - Robert: Got us a van. Plain, inconspicuous, just how we like it.\r\n20.09.2022 18:43:27 - Reba: Great work, team.

Don't try to chase what's popular, authenticity matters a lot in podcasting.\r\n20.09.2022 01:37:34 - Ronnie: Absolutely agree with Nadir. Also, invest in good quality equipment from the start. It's crucial for a good listening experience.\r\n20.09.2022 01:38:20 - Sheree: Definitely! And don't forget about promoting your podcast. Social media can be a good start.\r\n20.09.2022 01:39:47 - Robert: You should also consider your podcast format.

I'd be happy to share.\r\n19.09.2022 21:18:36 - Reba: It's great to hear everyone's hobbies. They all sound so interesting!\r\n19.09.2022 21:19:33 - Ronnie: Yes, maybe we can all try out each other's hobbies sometime.\r\n19.09.2022 21:20:26 - Sheree: That sounds like a great idea, Ronnie! Let's do it.\r\n19.09.2022 21:21:14 - Reba: Count me in! I'd love to learn more about gardening, Nadir.\r\n19.09.2022 21:22:21 - Nadir: Absolutely, Reba!

Any suggestions on how to get started?\r\n20.09.2022 01:36:31 - Nadir: That's a great idea Reba! I think you should focus on what you are passionate about. Don't try to chase what's popular, authenticity matters a lot in podcasting.\r\n20.09.2022 01:37:34 - Ronnie: Absolutely agree with Nadir. Also, invest in good quality equipment from the start. It's crucial for a good listening experience.\r\n20.09.2022 01:38:20 - Sheree: Definitely! And don't forget about promoting your podcast. Social media can be a good start.\r\n20.09.2022 01:39:47 - Robert: You should also consider your podcast format. Whether it's going to be interview-based, storytelling, or educational can really shape your content.\r\n20.09.2022 01:41:37 - Reba: These are all great suggestions! Thank you, everyone.

And remember, consistency is key.\r\n20.09.2022 06:27:40 - Reba: Hi everyone, I just finished reading 'The Alchemist'. Has anyone else read it?\r\n20.09.2022 06:28:43 - Nadir: Yes, I have. I found it quite enlightening. What did you think, Reba?\r\n20.09.2022 06:29:46 - Reba: I loved it! It really made me think about my personal journey and goals.\r\n20.09.2022 06:31:24 - Ronnie: I haven't read it yet, but I've heard a lot of good things. Would you recommend it, Reba?\r\n20.09.2022 06:32:03 - Reba: Absolutely, Ronnie! I think it's a must-read.\r\n20.09.2022 06:33:17 - Sheree: I've read it too and I can second that. It's a great book.\r\n20.09.2022 06:34:56 - Robert: I'm not much of a reader, but you guys are making me want to pick it up!\r\n20.09.2022 06:36:32 - Nadir: You should, Robert. It's quite a short read but very profound.\r\n20.09.2022 06:37:13 - Ronnie: I'll definitely add it to my reading list then!\r\n20.09.2022 06:38:05 - Sheree: Same here, Ronnie. It's been a while since I read a good book.\r\n20.09.2022 06:38:53 - Reba: That's great to hear, guys! I can't wait to hear your thoughts on it.\r\n20.09.2022 06:40:24 - Robert: Alright, I'm convinced. I'll buy it this weekend.\r\n20.09.2022 06:41:50 - Nadir: Looking forward to our next book discussion then!\r\n20.09.2022 06:43:49 - Ronnie: Me too! Thanks for the recommendation, Reba and Nadir.\r\n20.09.2022 06:45:23 - Reba: You're welcome, Ronnie! Happy reading everyone!\r\n20.09.2022 09:14:45 - Reba: Hey guys, have you tried the new update of 'Breath of the Wild' yet?\r\n20.09.2022 09:16:43 - Nadir: Not yet, Reba. I've been hooked on 'Among Us'. Anyone else playing?\r\n20.09.2022 09:18:43 - Ronnie: I am, Nadir! It's a great game for strategy. We should get a group together for it.\r\n20.09.2022 09:20:22 - Sheree: Count me in! I love 'Among Us'. I usually play on the 'Polus' map.\r\n20.09.2022 09:22:20 - Robert: Same here. It's great fun. Let's set up a time this weekend?\r\n20.09.2022 09:23:09 - Nadir: Sounds like a plan. I'll set up a group chat for us to coordinate.\r\n20.09.2022 09:25:09 - Reba: Great! Looking forward to it.\r\n20.09.2022 09:26:03 - Ronnie: Me too. It's been a while since we had a group game.\r\n20.09.2022 09:26:49 - Sheree: Can't wait! See you guys in the game.\r\n20.09.2022 09:28:13 - Robert: Sounds good. See you guys then.\r\n20.09.2022 12:23:37 - Reba: Hello everyone, have you seen the latest news on climate change?\r\n20.09.2022 12:25:01 - Nadir: Yes, I just read an article about it. The situation is becoming more critical.\r\n20.09.2022 12:25:32 - Ronnie: I agree, Nadir. It's alarming how rapidly the Arctic ice is melting.\r\n20.09.2022 12:26:41 - Sheree: Not just the Arctic, even our local weather patterns have been so unpredictable lately.\r\n20.09.2022 12:28:41 - Robert: True Sheree, it's high time we start taking some serious action.\r\n20.09.2022 12:30:38 - Reba: I was thinking the same. Maybe we should start by minimizing our carbon footprint.\r\n20.09.2022 12:31:17 - Nadir: That's a good start, Reba. We should also encourage others to do the same.\r\n20.09.2022 12:31:58 - Ronnie: Agreed. Also, awareness about the situation is crucial. Many people are still unaware of the gravity of the situation.\r\n20.09.2022 12:33:19 - Sheree: That's right Ronnie. More awareness campaigns are needed.\r\n20.09.2022 12:35:13 - Robert: Let's each do our part and hope for the best.\r\n20.09.2022 16:30:57 - Reba: Hey guys, I've been thinking about our next group adventure. Any thoughts?\r\n20.09.2022 16:32:33 - Nadir: Great idea, Reba! I think we should visit somewhere exotic.\r\n20.09.2022 16:34:12 - Ronnie: What about a safari trip to Africa? I've heard it's a unique experience.\r\n20.09.2022 16:35:09 - Sheree: That sounds awesome, Ronnie. But we also need to consider the budget.\r\n20.09.2022 16:36:37 - Robert: How about backpacking across Europe? It's affordable and we can explore different cultures.\r\n20.09.2022 16:37:54 - Reba: I love the idea, Robert! We could start from Spain and make our way to Greece.\r\n20.09.2022 16:39:13 - Nadir: Sounds like a plan! We should make a list of must-visit places and things to do.\r\n20.09.2022 16:40:53 - Ronnie: Absolutely, Nadir. Also, we need to check the best time to visit these countries.\r\n20.09.2022 16:42:48 - Sheree: Yes, and let's not forget about food. We must try local cuisines in each country.\r\n20.09.2022 16:44:24 - Robert: Agreed, Sheree. I can't wait to try some authentic pizza in Italy.\r\n20.09.2022 16:45:46 - Reba: Sounds like we have a plan, guys. Let's start preparing for our European adventure.\r\n20.09.2022 18:30:00 - Reba: Alright team, we have a new job. The target is the National Museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:31:29 - Nadir: Sounds risky, Reba. What's the prize?\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:28 - Reba: A priceless artifact, The Heart of the Ocean. It's worth the risk.\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:58 - Ronnie: I'm in. I can handle the security systems.\r\n20.09.2022 18:35:48 - Sheree: I'll get us the blueprints of the museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:37:15 - Robert: And I can arrange our getaway vehicle.\r\n20.09.2022 18:38:21 - Reba: Excellent. Everyone knows their role. Let's meet at the usual spot tomorrow to iron out the details.\r\n20.09.2022 18:39:48 - Nadir: I've got a feeling this is going to be a big one.\r\n20.09.2022 18:40:54 - Ronnie: Just another day at the office, Nadir.\r\n20.09.2022 18:41:48 - Sheree: Blueprints are in hand. This place is a maze.\r\n20.09.2022 18:42:49 - Robert: Got us a van. Plain, inconspicuous, just how we like it.\r\n20.09.2022 18:43:27 - Reba: Great work, team.

Why do you ask?\r\n10.05.2022 13:48:34 - Joshua: Just for fun, how do you think you would go about it if it was a fictional scenario?\r\n10.05.2022 13:50:27 - Renea: Hmm, I'd probably start by studying the security system in depth.\r\n10.05.2022 13:52:01 - Joshua: Right, and how would you bypass the cameras?\r\n10.05.2022 13:52:59 - Renea: Maybe hack into the system and loop the feed?\r\n10.05.2022 13:54:32 - Joshua: Good idea, and what about the laser security?\r\n10.05.2022 13:55:39 - Renea: I'd use smoke or dust to reveal them, then carefully navigate through.\r\n10.05.2022 13:56:48 - Joshua: Lastly, how would you open the vault?\r\n10.05.2022 13:57:48 - Renea: I'd have to figure out the lock mechanism. Might even need a safe-cracker.\r\n10.05.2022 13:58:27 - Joshua: Interesting. Thanks for indulging me, Renea.\r\n10.05.2022 15:03:00 - Joshua: Hey Renea, have you seen the latest news about the Mars Rover?\r\n10.05.2022 15:04:51 - Renea: Hey Joshua, yeah I saw something about it. Didn't it find something interesting?\r\n10.05.2022 15:06:24 - Joshua: Yeah! It seems to have found new signs of ancient microbial life. It's a huge discovery.\r\n10.05.2022 15:08:15 - Renea: Oh wow, that's amazing. I wonder what this means for the future of space exploration.\r\n10.05.2022 15:09:40 - Joshua: I think it opens up a lot of possibilities. Maybe there was life on Mars in the past.\r\n10.05.2022 15:11:30 - Renea: That's an exciting thought. Do you think there could still be life on Mars now?\r\n10.05.2022 15:12:46 - Joshua: It's hard to say, but I think it's definitely a possibility. We'll have to wait and see what the scientists say.\r\n10.05.2022 15:13:47 - Renea: True. It's an exciting time to be alive, isn't it?\r\n10.05.2022 15:14:33 - Joshua: Definitely. I can't wait to see what other discoveries are made in the future.\r\n10.05.2022 15:16:24 - Renea: Same here. Let's keep each other updated on any new developments.\r\n10.05.2022 15:17:00 - Joshua: Sounds like a plan.\r\n10.05.2022 16:35:34 - Joshua: Hey Renea, have you seen the new Marvel movie yet?\r\n10.05.2022 16:36:30 - Renea,Hi Joshua, yes, I saw it last weekend. It was amazing!: None\r\n10.05.2022 16:37:25 - Joshua: I thought so too! The special effects were really top-notch.\r\n10.05.2022 16:38:49 - Renea: Definitely. And the storyline was so engaging. I can't wait for the next movie.\r\n10.05.2022 16:40:17 - Joshua: Same here. I heard it's coming out next year.\r\n10.05.2022 16:41:40 - Renea: Yes, I also read that. Any other movies you're looking forward to?\r\n10.05.2022 16:42:15 - Joshua: Actually, I'm quite excited about the new James Bond movie. How about you?\r\n10.05.2022 16:43:25 - Renea: Oh, I can't wait to see that one as well. I'm a big fan of the franchise.\r\n10.05.2022 16:45:19 - Joshua: Great! Maybe we can go watch it together.\r\n10.05.2022 16:46:24 - Renea: That sounds like a plan. Let's do that.\r\n10.05.2022 20:00:01 - Joshua: Hey Renea, have you seen the lineup for the upcoming concert?\r\n10.05.2022 20:00:59 - Renea: No, I haven't. Who's performing?\r\n10.05.2022 20:01:53 - Joshua: It's a mix of different genres. The headliners are Imagine Dragons and Post Malone.\r\n10.05.2022 20:03:07 - Renea: That sounds great. I love Post Malone!\r\n10.05.2022 20:03:52 - Joshua: Me too! They also have a couple of local bands that are really good.\r\n10.05.2022 20:05:31 - Renea: I'm intrigued. When is it?\r\n10.05.2022 20:06:18 - Joshua: It's next Saturday. Are you free?\r\n10.05.2022 20:07:43 - Renea: Yeah, I don't have any plans. Where's the concert?\r\n10.05.2022 20:09:17 - Joshua: It's at the city park. They've got a huge stage set up.\r\n10.05.2022 20:09:47 - Renea: That sounds amazing. Do you know how much the tickets are?\r\n10.05.2022 20:11:19 - Joshua: I think they're around $50. Would you like me to get us a pair?\r\n10.05.2022 20:12:08 - Renea: Yes, please. That would be awesome.\r\n10.05.2022 20:13:24 - Joshua: Great, I'll get them today. Looking forward to it!\r\n10.05.2022 20:15:15 - Renea: Me too. Thanks, Joshua.\r\n10.05.2022 22:10:39 - Joshua: Hey Renea, how's it going with the new math teacher?\r\n10.05.2022 22:11:23 - Renea: Hi Joshua! She's really good, explains everything clearly. But the homework is quite a lot.\r\n10.05.2022 22:12:44 - Joshua: Yeah, I've heard she's strict. Think we'll have a lot of tests?\r\n10.05.2022 22:14:12 - Renea: I guess so. But I think it's better to understand the material than just memorizing it.\r\n10.05.2022 22:15:06 - Joshua: You're right. Have you started studying for the biology test yet?\r\n10.05.2022 22:17:00 - Renea: Not yet, but I've gathered all my notes. We should study together, what do you think?\r\n10.05.2022 22:17:52 - Joshua: That sounds like a good idea, Renea.

But before that, let's discuss the best time to travel to these places.\r\n01.03.2022 16:18:02 - Katherine: For Japan, it's best to go in Spring for the cherry blossoms, or in Autumn for the fall colors.\r\n01.03.2022 16:19:57 - Ronda: In Kenya, the best wildlife viewing months are during the dry season from late June to October.\r\n01.03.2022 16:21:16 - Mario: And for Greece, the best time is from April to early November. The weather is warm and there's little rain.\r\n01.03.2022 16:22:39 - Desiree: For Iceland, the best time to see the Northern Lights is from late September to late March.\r\n01.03.2022 16:23:37 - Jason: Perfect, let's put all this info into the poll too.\r\n01.03.2022 16:24:30 - Katherine: Great!

Let's keep everything low-key as usual.\r\n01.03.2022 19:43:19 - Mario: Agreed. See you all tomorrow.\r\n01.03.2022 21:19:42 - Jason: Hey guys, I just finished reading 'The Alchemist'. Absolutely loved it!\r\n01.03.2022 21:20:24 - Desiree: Oh, I love Paulo Coelho's work! Have you read 'Brida' yet, Jason?\r\n01.03.2022 21:22:07 - Katherine: I have heard a lot about 'The Alchemist', but never got around to reading it. What's it about, Jason?\r\n01.03.2022 21:24:05 - Jason: It's about a young shepherd named Santiago who embarks on a journey to find a worldly treasure. But, along the way, he discovers himself.\r\n01.03.2022 21:25:22 - Ronda: Sounds interesting. I might give it a read.\r\n01.03.2022 21:26:34 - Mario: I prefer non-fiction. Currently reading 'Sapiens' by Yuval Noah Harari. It's mind-blowing!\r\n01.03.2022 21:27:33 - Desiree: I've heard great things about 'Sapiens', Mario. What's it about?\r\n01.03.2022 21:28:08 - Mario: It's about the history of humankind, right from the evolution of Homo Sapiens to the present day. It presents some thought-provoking perspectives.\r\n01.03.2022 21:29:48 - Katherine: Wow, that sounds intriguing, Mario. I'll add it to my reading list.\r\n01.03.2022 21:31:13 - Ronda: I'm into mystery novels. Just started with 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.\r\n01.03.2022 21:32:54 - Jason: That's a great book, Ronda. You're in for a treat!\r\n01.03.2022 21:34:22 - Desiree: I'll have to check that out too. So many books, so little time!\r\n01.03.2022 21:35:51 - Katherine: Tell me about it, Desiree. My reading list keeps growing!\r\n01.03.2022 21:37:25 - Jason: Haha, same here. Well, happy reading everyone!\r\n01.03.2022 22:25:26 - Jason: So what do you guys think about existentialism?\r\n01.03.2022 22:27:12 - Desiree: Well, I find it quite intriguing. It's all about finding self and personal meaning in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:28:26 - Katherine: I agree with Desiree, but it also feels like a lonely philosophy. It relies so heavily on the individual.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:08 - Ronda: But isn't that the point, Katherine? To highlight the importance of individual choice in a seemingly indifferent universe.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:42 - Mario: I see your points, but I lean more towards Absurdism. Life is meaningless and it's up to us to create our own purpose.\r\n01.03.2022 22:32:00 - Jason: That's interesting, Mario. But doesn't that sound similar to Existentialism?\r\n01.03.2022 22:32:47 - Mario: They're similar, but Absurdism is more about embracing the absurdity of life rather than seeking personal meaning.\r\n01.03.2022 22:33:23 - Katherine: I can see why you'd think that way, Mario. It's definitely a unique perspective.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:12 - Desiree: Regardless of our philosophical inclinations, I think it's beautiful how we can interpret and find our own meanings in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:58 - Ronda: Absolutely, Desiree. That's the beauty of philosophy, isn't it? It allows us to explore different perspectives and possibilities.\r\n01.03.2022 22:37:08 - Jason: Well said, everyone. This was a great discussion.\r\n02.03.2022 03:28:34 - Jason: Hey guys, have you heard the new Coldplay album?\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:08 - Desiree: Yes, I actually have. I think it's one of their best works yet.\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:57 - Katherine: I haven't listened to it yet. Is it really that good?\r\n02.03.2022 03:31:31 - Ronda: I'm not much of a Coldplay fan, but I'll give it a listen.\r\n02.03.2022 03:33:14 - Mario: I'm with Ronda. Not a fan, but I won't knock it until I try it.\r\n02.03.2022 03:34:29 - Jason: That's the spirit, guys! Let's all give it a listen and discuss it next time.\r\n02.03.2022 03:35:47 - Desiree: Sounds like a plan. Music discussion night, here we come!\r\n02.03.2022 03:37:02 - Katherine: I'm in! I'll listen to it tonight.\r\n02.03.2022 03:37:59 - Ronda: Same here. It'll be a new experience for sure.\r\n02.03.2022 03:39:52 - Mario: Count me in as well.

It's definitely a unique perspective.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:12 - Desiree: Regardless of our philosophical inclinations, I think it's beautiful how we can interpret and find our own meanings in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:35:58 - Ronda: Absolutely, Desiree.

This was a great discussion.\r\n02.03.2022 03:28:34 - Jason: Hey guys, have you heard the new Coldplay album?\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:08 - Desiree: Yes, I actually have. I think it's one of their best works yet.\r\n02.03.2022 03:30:57 - Katherine: I haven't listened to it yet. Is it really that good?\r\n02.03.2022 03:31:31 - Ronda: I'm not much of a Coldplay fan, but I'll give it a listen.\r\n02.03.2022 03:33:14 - Mario: I'm with Ronda. Not a fan, but I won't knock it until I try it.\r\n02.03.2022 03:34:29 - Jason: That's the spirit, guys! Let's all give it a listen and discuss it next time.\r\n02.03.2022 03:35:47 - Desiree: Sounds like a plan. Music discussion night, here we come!\r\n02.03.2022 03:37:02 - Katherine: I'm in!

I've always wanted to see the Northern Lights in Iceland. \r\n01.03.2022 16:13:15 - Katherine: That sounds amazing, Desiree! I'd love to go to Japan, the culture and food have always intrigued me.\r\n01.03.2022 16:13:48 - Ronda: Japan sounds great, Katherine. I have always wanted to go on a safari in Kenya though.\r\n01.03.2022 16:15:03 - Mario: I have a soft spot for history. So, Greece is on top of my list. \r\n01.03.2022 16:16:35 - Jason: Great choices everyone! Let's put these options into a poll and vote?\r\n01.03.2022 16:17:12 - Desiree: Good idea Jason. But before that, let's discuss the best time to travel to these places.\r\n01.03.2022 16:18:02 - Katherine: For Japan, it's best to go in Spring for the cherry blossoms, or in Autumn for the fall colors.\r\n01.03.2022 16:19:57 - Ronda: In Kenya, the best wildlife viewing months are during the dry season from late June to October.\r\n01.03.2022 16:21:16 - Mario: And for Greece, the best time is from April to early November. The weather is warm and there's little rain.\r\n01.03.2022 16:22:39 - Desiree: For Iceland, the best time to see the Northern Lights is from late September to late March.\r\n01.03.2022 16:23:37 - Jason: Perfect, let's put all this info into the poll too.\r\n01.03.2022 16:24:30 - Katherine: Great! Looking forward to this trip, wherever we end up going!\r\n01.03.2022 16:26:06 - Ronda: Same here, can't wait!\r\n01.03.2022 19:30:00 - Jason: Hey team, I've been thinking about our next target. What do you all think about the old mansion on Main Street?\r\n01.03.2022 19:31:39 - Desiree: Sounds promising, Jason. But isn't it rumored to be haunted?\r\n01.03.2022 19:33:34 - Katherine: That's just a myth, Desiree. I think it could be a good idea. We need to plan carefully though.\r\n01.03.2022 19:34:20 - Ronda: I agree with Katherine. We need to ensure we have all exit points covered.\r\n01.03.2022 19:35:05 - Mario: I can handle the security systems. But we need someone on the lookout too.\r\n01.03.2022 19:37:02 - Jason: Good point, Mario. Desiree, could you handle that?\r\n01.03.2022 19:38:54 - Desiree: Sure, Jason. I'll keep an eye out for any unexpected surprises.\r\n01.03.2022 19:40:11 - Katherine: Let's meet tomorrow to discuss the plan in detail.\r\n01.03.2022 19:41:28 - Ronda: Works for me. Let's keep everything low-key as usual.\r\n01.03.2022 19:43:19 - Mario: Agreed. See you all tomorrow.\r\n01.03.2022 21:19:42 - Jason: Hey guys, I just finished reading 'The Alchemist'. Absolutely loved it!\r\n01.03.2022 21:20:24 - Desiree: Oh, I love Paulo Coelho's work! Have you read 'Brida' yet, Jason?\r\n01.03.2022 21:22:07 - Katherine: I have heard a lot about 'The Alchemist', but never got around to reading it. What's it about, Jason?\r\n01.03.2022 21:24:05 - Jason: It's about a young shepherd named Santiago who embarks on a journey to find a worldly treasure. But, along the way, he discovers himself.\r\n01.03.2022 21:25:22 - Ronda: Sounds interesting. I might give it a read.\r\n01.03.2022 21:26:34 - Mario: I prefer non-fiction. Currently reading 'Sapiens' by Yuval Noah Harari. It's mind-blowing!\r\n01.03.2022 21:27:33 - Desiree: I've heard great things about 'Sapiens', Mario. What's it about?\r\n01.03.2022 21:28:08 - Mario: It's about the history of humankind, right from the evolution of Homo Sapiens to the present day. It presents some thought-provoking perspectives.\r\n01.03.2022 21:29:48 - Katherine: Wow, that sounds intriguing, Mario. I'll add it to my reading list.\r\n01.03.2022 21:31:13 - Ronda: I'm into mystery novels. Just started with 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.\r\n01.03.2022 21:32:54 - Jason: That's a great book, Ronda. You're in for a treat!\r\n01.03.2022 21:34:22 - Desiree: I'll have to check that out too. So many books, so little time!\r\n01.03.2022 21:35:51 - Katherine: Tell me about it, Desiree. My reading list keeps growing!\r\n01.03.2022 21:37:25 - Jason: Haha, same here. Well, happy reading everyone!\r\n01.03.2022 22:25:26 - Jason: So what do you guys think about existentialism?\r\n01.03.2022 22:27:12 - Desiree: Well, I find it quite intriguing. It's all about finding self and personal meaning in life.\r\n01.03.2022 22:28:26 - Katherine: I agree with Desiree, but it also feels like a lonely philosophy. It relies so heavily on the individual.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:08 - Ronda: But isn't that the point, Katherine? To highlight the importance of individual choice in a seemingly indifferent universe.\r\n01.03.2022 22:30:42 - Mario: I see your points, but I lean more towards Absurdism. Life is meaningless and it's up to us to create our own purpose.\r\n01.03.2022 22:32:00 - Jason: That's interesting, Mario.

How can I assist you today?\r\n28.08.2024 01:34:35 - Eusebia: I wanted to discuss the new project we are working on. I'm struggling a bit with the initial stages.\r\n28.08.2024 01:35:33 - Azaiah: Of course, Eusebia. Can you tell me exactly where you're facing issues?\r\n28.08.2024 01:37:14 - Eusebia: I am having trouble understanding the client's requirement. It's a bit complex.\r\n28.08.2024 01:38:12 - Azaiah: I understand. Let's break it down together. We can start by identifying the main goals the client wants to achieve.\r\n28.08.2024 01:39:59 - Eusebia: That sounds like a good idea. The main goal, as I understand it, is to revamp their existing website and make it more user-friendly.\r\n28.08.2024 01:41:04 - Azaiah: That's a great start. Now, we need to figure out what 'user-friendly' means to them. Have they provided any specifics?\r\n28.08.2024 01:42:19 - Eusebia: Yes, they mentioned they want a simple, clean design with easy navigation.\r\n28.08.2024 01:43:23 - Azaiah: Perfect. Let's start working on a design outline based on this. I'll assist you throughout the process.\r\n28.08.2024 01:45:08 - Eusebia: Thank you, Azaiah. Your guidance is truly appreciated.\r\n28.08.2024 01:46:04 - Azaiah: No problem, Eusebia. We're a team and we're in this together.\r\n28.08.2024 05:43:01 - Eusebia: Hey Azaiah, have you heard about the upcoming concert in town?\r\n28.08.2024 05:44:50 - Azaiah: No, I haven't. Who's performing?\r\n28.08.2024 05:46:08 - Eusebia: It's the rock band, The Rolling Stones.\r\n28.08.2024 05:46:48 - Azaiah: Oh wow, I am a huge fan of them. When is the concert?\r\n28.08.2024 05:48:48 - Eusebia: It's on the 25th of next month.\r\n28.08.2024 05:50:04 - Azaiah: That's perfect. I am free that day. Where can I get the tickets?\r\n28.08.2024 05:51:54 - Eusebia: They are selling them online. I can send you the link.\r\n28.08.2024 05:53:11 - Azaiah: Please do, and thanks for the info!\r\n28.08.2024 05:53:59 - Eusebia: You're welcome. It's going to be a blast!\r\n28.08.2024 05:55:59 - Azaiah: I can't wait. Let's plan to go together.\r\n28.08.2024 05:57:42 - Eusebia: Sounds like a plan. See you at the concert, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 05:58:53 - Azaiah: Definitely, see you there, Eusebia.\r\n28.08.2024 08:15:10 - Eusebia: Hi Azaiah, I have been having some health issues lately.\r\n28.08.2024 08:16:27 - Azaiah: Oh no Eusebia, sorry to hear that. What seems to be the problem?\r\n28.08.2024 08:18:13 - Eusebia: I have been feeling very tired and weak. I also have frequent headaches.\r\n28.08.2024 08:19:49 - Azaiah: It sounds like you need to see a doctor, Eusebia. It could be something simple like a vitamin deficiency, but it's best to get checked.\r\n28.08.2024 08:20:43 - Eusebia: Yes, I agree. I have scheduled an appointment for next week.\r\n28.08.2024 08:22:32 - Azaiah: That's good, Eusebia. In the meantime, try to eat healthily and rest as much as you can.\r\n28.08.2024 08:24:09 - Eusebia: I will. Thank you for your concern, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 08:26:02 - Azaiah: Of course, Eusebia. Health is important. Let me know how it goes, okay?\r\n28.08.2024 08:27:11 - Eusebia: I definitely will. Thanks, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 08:28:56 - Azaiah: You're welcome, Eusebia. Take care.\r\n28.08.2024 13:35:47 - Eusebia: Hey Azaiah, how are you finding your college experience so far?\r\n28.08.2024 13:36:39 - Azaiah: Hi Eusebia, it's been a mix of emotions. There's a lot of studying, but I'm enjoying my course and the social life.\r\n28.08.2024 13:38:22 - Eusebia: That's great to hear! What's been the most challenging part for you?\r\n28.08.2024 13:40:08 - Azaiah: I think the most challenging part has been managing my time effectively. There's so much to do and so little time.\r\n28.08.2024 13:41:18 - Eusebia: I can definitely relate to that. Do you have any tips on how to handle it?\r\n28.08.2024 13:42:40 - Azaiah: I try to make a schedule every week and stick to it. It helps to keep track of assignments and exams.\r\n28.08.2024 13:43:49 - Eusebia: That's a good strategy. I'll try it out. Thanks, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 13:45:24 - Azaiah: No problem, Eusebia.

It's a bit complex.\r\n28.08.2024 01:38:12 - Azaiah: I understand. Let's break it down together. We can start by identifying the main goals the client wants to achieve.\r\n28.08.2024 01:39:59 - Eusebia: That sounds like a good idea. The main goal, as I understand it, is to revamp their existing website and make it more user-friendly.\r\n28.08.2024 01:41:04 - Azaiah: That's a great start.

When is the concert?\r\n28.08.2024 05:48:48 - Eusebia: It's on the 25th of next month.\r\n28.08.2024 05:50:04 - Azaiah: That's perfect. I am free that day.

What seems to be the problem?\r\n28.08.2024 08:18:13 - Eusebia: I have been feeling very tired and weak. I also have frequent headaches.\r\n28.08.2024 08:19:49 - Azaiah: It sounds like you need to see a doctor, Eusebia. It could be something simple like a vitamin deficiency, but it's best to get checked.\r\n28.08.2024 08:20:43 - Eusebia: Yes, I agree. I have scheduled an appointment for next week.\r\n28.08.2024 08:22:32 - Azaiah: That's good, Eusebia.

There's a lot of studying, but I'm enjoying my course and the social life.\r\n28.08.2024 13:38:22 - Eusebia: That's great to hear! What's been the most challenging part for you?\r\n28.08.2024 13:40:08 - Azaiah: I think the most challenging part has been managing my time effectively. There's so much to do and so little time.\r\n28.08.2024 13:41:18 - Eusebia: I can definitely relate to that. Do you have any tips on how to handle it?\r\n28.08.2024 13:42:40 - Azaiah: I try to make a schedule every week and stick to it. It helps to keep track of assignments and exams.\r\n28.08.2024 13:43:49 - Eusebia: That's a good strategy. I'll try it out. Thanks, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 13:45:24 - Azaiah: No problem, Eusebia.

Your guidance is truly appreciated.\r\n28.08.2024 01:46:04 - Azaiah: No problem, Eusebia. We're a team and we're in this together.\r\n28.08.2024 05:43:01 - Eusebia: Hey Azaiah, have you heard about the upcoming concert in town?\r\n28.08.2024 05:44:50 - Azaiah: No, I haven't. Who's performing?\r\n28.08.2024 05:46:08 - Eusebia: It's the rock band, The Rolling Stones.\r\n28.08.2024 05:46:48 - Azaiah: Oh wow, I am a huge fan of them. When is the concert?\r\n28.08.2024 05:48:48 - Eusebia: It's on the 25th of next month.\r\n28.08.2024 05:50:04 - Azaiah: That's perfect. I am free that day. Where can I get the tickets?\r\n28.08.2024 05:51:54 - Eusebia: They are selling them online. I can send you the link.\r\n28.08.2024 05:53:11 - Azaiah: Please do, and thanks for the info!\r\n28.08.2024 05:53:59 - Eusebia: You're welcome. It's going to be a blast!\r\n28.08.2024 05:55:59 - Azaiah: I can't wait. Let's plan to go together.\r\n28.08.2024 05:57:42 - Eusebia: Sounds like a plan. See you at the concert, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 05:58:53 - Azaiah: Definitely, see you there, Eusebia.\r\n28.08.2024 08:15:10 - Eusebia: Hi Azaiah, I have been having some health issues lately.\r\n28.08.2024 08:16:27 - Azaiah: Oh no Eusebia, sorry to hear that. What seems to be the problem?\r\n28.08.2024 08:18:13 - Eusebia: I have been feeling very tired and weak. I also have frequent headaches.\r\n28.08.2024 08:19:49 - Azaiah: It sounds like you need to see a doctor, Eusebia. It could be something simple like a vitamin deficiency, but it's best to get checked.\r\n28.08.2024 08:20:43 - Eusebia: Yes, I agree. I have scheduled an appointment for next week.\r\n28.08.2024 08:22:32 - Azaiah: That's good, Eusebia. In the meantime, try to eat healthily and rest as much as you can.\r\n28.08.2024 08:24:09 - Eusebia: I will. Thank you for your concern, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 08:26:02 - Azaiah: Of course, Eusebia. Health is important. Let me know how it goes, okay?\r\n28.08.2024 08:27:11 - Eusebia: I definitely will. Thanks, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 08:28:56 - Azaiah: You're welcome, Eusebia. Take care.\r\n28.08.2024 13:35:47 - Eusebia: Hey Azaiah, how are you finding your college experience so far?\r\n28.08.2024 13:36:39 - Azaiah: Hi Eusebia, it's been a mix of emotions. There's a lot of studying, but I'm enjoying my course and the social life.\r\n28.08.2024 13:38:22 - Eusebia: That's great to hear! What's been the most challenging part for you?\r\n28.08.2024 13:40:08 - Azaiah: I think the most challenging part has been managing my time effectively. There's so much to do and so little time.\r\n28.08.2024 13:41:18 - Eusebia: I can definitely relate to that. Do you have any tips on how to handle it?\r\n28.08.2024 13:42:40 - Azaiah: I try to make a schedule every week and stick to it. It helps to keep track of assignments and exams.\r\n28.08.2024 13:43:49 - Eusebia: That's a good strategy. I'll try it out. Thanks, Azaiah.\r\n28.08.2024 13:45:24 - Azaiah: No problem, Eusebia.

Any must-see sights or activities?\r\n25.08.2024 16:35:31 - Paulette: In Rome, the Colosseum and Vatican are must-sees.

I'll send the notes now.\r\n25.08.2024 21:49:36 - Amanda: Thanks, Paulette. You're a lifesaver!\r\n25.08.2024 21:50:13 - Paulette: Anything for a friend. Let's ace this semester together!\r\n26.08.2024 00:40:31 - Amanda: Hey Paulette! Have you watched the latest season of The Crown yet?\r\n26.08.2024 00:42:30 - Paulette: Hi Amanda! No, not yet. Is it any good?\r\n26.08.2024 00:43:53 - Amanda: Oh it's brilliant! The portrayal of Princess Diana is just amazing.\r\n26.08.2024 00:45:18 - Paulette: Oh wow, I'll have to check it out then!\r\n26.08.2024 00:46:12 - Amanda: You definitely should. Do you have any show recommendations for me?\r\n26.08.2024 00:47:33 - Paulette: Hmm, have you tried watching The Queen's Gambit? It's not exactly a historical drama, but it's really entertaining.\r\n26.08.2024 00:49:31 - Amanda: No, I haven't. I'll add it to my watch list. Thanks!\r\n26.08.2024 00:50:37 - Paulette: No problem! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n26.08.2024 00:51:41 - Amanda: Sure thing. By the way, have you heard of the new movie Tenet?\r\n26.08.2024 00:52:33 - Paulette: Yes, I've heard of it but not watched it. Is it worth watching?\r\n26.08.2024 00:53:24 - Amanda: It's a bit complicated but if you love Nolan's movies, you'll enjoy it.\r\n26.08.2024 00:55:06 - Paulette: I do enjoy his movies. I'll give it a go then. Thanks, Amanda!\r\n26.08.2024 00:56:02 - Amanda: You're welcome! Enjoy your movie night, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 05:32:44 - Amanda: Hi Paulette, have you ever pondered about the concept of existence? What it truly means to exist?\r\n26.08.2024 05:34:36 - Paulette: Hello Amanda, that's a deep question. I think existence is subjective. It's different for every individual based on their perception.\r\n26.08.2024 05:35:15 - Amanda: That's an interesting viewpoint. What about the idea of reality? Do you think our reality is constructed by our minds or is it an independent entity?\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:13 - Paulette: I lean towards the concept of constructed reality. Our experiences and perceptions shape our reality.\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:59 - Amanda: So, would you say our thoughts and consciousness shape the reality around us?\r\n26.08.2024 05:38:20 - Paulette: Yes, I believe so. But at the same time, I think there are certain objective truths or realities that exist beyond our perceptions.\r\n26.08.2024 05:39:54 - Amanda: It's fascinating to think about, isn't it? How our minds can potentially shape the world around us.\r\n26.08.2024 05:41:00 - Paulette: Definitely, it's an intriguing subject. Philosophy really makes you question the world and your place in it.\r\n26.08.2024 11:07:10 - Amanda: Hey Paulette, have you tried that new Italian restaurant downtown?\r\n26.08.2024 11:09:07 - Paulette: Hi Amanda, are you talking about Bella Napoli?\r\n26.08.2024 11:10:16 - Amanda: Yes, that's the one! I heard it's really good.\r\n26.08.2024 11:11:02 - Paulette: I've been there once. The pasta was amazing!\r\n26.08.2024 11:12:03 - Amanda: Really? What else did you try?\r\n26.08.2024 11:13:45 - Paulette: I also had the tiramisu. It was absolutely delicious.\r\n26.08.2024 11:14:49 - Amanda: That sounds great. I'm thinking of going there this weekend.\r\n26.08.2024 11:15:27 - Paulette: You should! And make sure to try their seafood risotto. It's their specialty.\r\n26.08.2024 11:17:22 - Amanda: Seafood risotto, got it. Thanks for the recommendation, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 11:18:50 - Paulette: You're welcome, Amanda. Enjoy your meal!\r\n26.08.2024 15:16:47 - Amanda: Hi Paulette, have you seen the new season of Stranger Things yet?\r\n26.08.2024 15:17:18 - Paulette: Hey Amanda, not yet. Is it good?\r\n26.08.2024 15:19:11 - Amanda: It's amazing! I love how they've developed the characters.\r\n26.08.2024 15:20:43 - Paulette: That sounds promising. I'll have to catch up soon.\r\n26.08.2024 15:22:33 - Amanda: You should! Oh, and have you seen The Witcher?\r\n26.08.2024 15:23:44 - Paulette: No, I haven't. Is it worth a watch?\r\n26.08.2024 15:25:10 - Amanda: Absolutely! The storyline is so intriguing.\r\n26.08.2024 15:27:05 - Paulette: I'll add that to my list too then. Thanks for the recommendations, Amanda.\r\n26.08.2024 15:27:55 - Amanda: You're welcome, Paulette! Enjoy your TV time.\r\n26.08.2024 15:29:51 - Paulette: Definitely will.

Where are you planning to go?\r\n25.08.2024 16:26:12 - Amanda: I was thinking about Europe. Maybe France or Italy.\r\n25.08.2024 16:27:44 - Paulette: Oh, both are great choices! Do you prefer cities or countryside?\r\n25.08.2024 16:28:51 - Amanda: I think a bit of both. I love history, but I also enjoy relaxing in nature.\r\n25.08.2024 16:30:21 - Paulette: Then I would recommend Italy. You can visit Rome and Florence for the history and Tuscany for the beautiful countryside.\r\n25.08.2024 16:31:11 - Amanda: That sounds perfect. Do you have any hotel recommendations?\r\n25.08.2024 16:32:38 - Paulette: In Rome, Hotel Hassler is a great option. In Florence, check out the St. Regis, and in Tuscany, Castello Banfi il Borgo is beautiful.\r\n25.08.2024 16:33:33 - Amanda: Thanks Paulette, I will check them out. Any must-see sights or activities?\r\n25.08.2024 16:35:31 - Paulette: In Rome, the Colosseum and Vatican are must-sees. Florence is famous for its art galleries, and in Tuscany, you can go wine tasting.\r\n25.08.2024 16:36:24 - Amanda: Sounds amazing. I can't wait!\r\n25.08.2024 16:37:00 - Paulette: You're going to have a great time. Don't forget to try the local cuisine!\r\n25.08.2024 16:37:48 - Amanda: I won't!

Let's ace this semester together!\r\n26.08.2024 00:40:31 - Amanda: Hey Paulette! Have you watched the latest season of The Crown yet?\r\n26.08.2024 00:42:30 - Paulette: Hi Amanda! No, not yet. Is it any good?\r\n26.08.2024 00:43:53 - Amanda: Oh it's brilliant! The portrayal of Princess Diana is just amazing.\r\n26.08.2024 00:45:18 - Paulette: Oh wow, I'll have to check it out then!\r\n26.08.2024 00:46:12 - Amanda: You definitely should. Do you have any show recommendations for me?\r\n26.08.2024 00:47:33 - Paulette: Hmm, have you tried watching The Queen's Gambit? It's not exactly a historical drama, but it's really entertaining.\r\n26.08.2024 00:49:31 - Amanda: No, I haven't. I'll add it to my watch list. Thanks!\r\n26.08.2024 00:50:37 - Paulette: No problem! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n26.08.2024 00:51:41 - Amanda: Sure thing. By the way, have you heard of the new movie Tenet?\r\n26.08.2024 00:52:33 - Paulette: Yes, I've heard of it but not watched it. Is it worth watching?\r\n26.08.2024 00:53:24 - Amanda: It's a bit complicated but if you love Nolan's movies, you'll enjoy it.\r\n26.08.2024 00:55:06 - Paulette: I do enjoy his movies. I'll give it a go then. Thanks, Amanda!\r\n26.08.2024 00:56:02 - Amanda: You're welcome! Enjoy your movie night, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 05:32:44 - Amanda: Hi Paulette, have you ever pondered about the concept of existence? What it truly means to exist?\r\n26.08.2024 05:34:36 - Paulette: Hello Amanda, that's a deep question. I think existence is subjective. It's different for every individual based on their perception.\r\n26.08.2024 05:35:15 - Amanda: That's an interesting viewpoint. What about the idea of reality? Do you think our reality is constructed by our minds or is it an independent entity?\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:13 - Paulette: I lean towards the concept of constructed reality. Our experiences and perceptions shape our reality.\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:59 - Amanda: So, would you say our thoughts and consciousness shape the reality around us?\r\n26.08.2024 05:38:20 - Paulette: Yes, I believe so. But at the same time, I think there are certain objective truths or realities that exist beyond our perceptions.\r\n26.08.2024 05:39:54 - Amanda: It's fascinating to think about, isn't it? How our minds can potentially shape the world around us.\r\n26.08.2024 05:41:00 - Paulette: Definitely, it's an intriguing subject. Philosophy really makes you question the world and your place in it.\r\n26.08.2024 11:07:10 - Amanda: Hey Paulette, have you tried that new Italian restaurant downtown?\r\n26.08.2024 11:09:07 - Paulette: Hi Amanda, are you talking about Bella Napoli?\r\n26.08.2024 11:10:16 - Amanda: Yes, that's the one! I heard it's really good.\r\n26.08.2024 11:11:02 - Paulette: I've been there once. The pasta was amazing!\r\n26.08.2024 11:12:03 - Amanda: Really? What else did you try?\r\n26.08.2024 11:13:45 - Paulette: I also had the tiramisu. It was absolutely delicious.\r\n26.08.2024 11:14:49 - Amanda: That sounds great. I'm thinking of going there this weekend.\r\n26.08.2024 11:15:27 - Paulette: You should! And make sure to try their seafood risotto. It's their specialty.\r\n26.08.2024 11:17:22 - Amanda: Seafood risotto, got it. Thanks for the recommendation, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 11:18:50 - Paulette: You're welcome, Amanda. Enjoy your meal!\r\n26.08.2024 15:16:47 - Amanda: Hi Paulette, have you seen the new season of Stranger Things yet?\r\n26.08.2024 15:17:18 - Paulette: Hey Amanda, not yet. Is it good?\r\n26.08.2024 15:19:11 - Amanda: It's amazing! I love how they've developed the characters.\r\n26.08.2024 15:20:43 - Paulette: That sounds promising. I'll have to catch up soon.\r\n26.08.2024 15:22:33 - Amanda: You should! Oh, and have you seen The Witcher?\r\n26.08.2024 15:23:44 - Paulette: No, I haven't. Is it worth a watch?\r\n26.08.2024 15:25:10 - Amanda: Absolutely! The storyline is so intriguing.\r\n26.08.2024 15:27:05 - Paulette: I'll add that to my list too then.

Do you prefer cities or countryside?\r\n25.08.2024 16:28:51 - Amanda: I think a bit of both. I love history, but I also enjoy relaxing in nature.\r\n25.08.2024 16:30:21 - Paulette: Then I would recommend Italy. You can visit Rome and Florence for the history and Tuscany for the beautiful countryside.\r\n25.08.2024 16:31:11 - Amanda: That sounds perfect. Do you have any hotel recommendations?\r\n25.08.2024 16:32:38 - Paulette: In Rome, Hotel Hassler is a great option.

Any must-see sights or activities?\r\n25.08.2024 16:35:31 - Paulette: In Rome, the Colosseum and Vatican are must-sees.

But only if you promise not to make us watch any documentaries, Liz.\r\n01.06.2022 18:30:00 - Joseph: Hey, I've got a new shipment coming in\r\n01.06.2022 18:30:30 - Elizabeth: That's great news Joseph. When can we expect it?\r\n01.06.2022 18:32:19 - Joseph: It should be by tomorrow night\r\n01.06.2022 18:33:33 - Justin: Are we talking about the same high-quality stuff?\r\n01.06.2022 18:35:23 - Joseph: Yes Justin, the same one. We need to ensure everything goes smoothly\r\n01.06.2022 18:36:20 - Elizabeth: I have the perfect location for the drop-off.

I've found it hard to stay motivated without the gym.\r\n01.06.2022 23:44:58 - Justin: I've actually been doing quite well with home workouts, surprisingly. It was tough initially, but I've found a rhythm now.\r\n01.06.2022 23:45:38 - Joseph: That's great, Justin! Elizabeth, perhaps you could try mixing things up a bit? Maybe try yoga or dance workouts?\r\n01.06.2022 23:46:42 - Elizabeth: I think that's a great idea, Joseph. I'll look into it.\r\n01.06.2022 23:47:13 - Justin: There are tons of free resources online, Elizabeth. I can send you some links if you'd like.\r\n01.06.2022 23:48:29 - Elizabeth: That would be great, Justin. Thanks a lot!\r\n01.06.2022 23:50:25 - Joseph: It's important that we all keep active, especially now. Remember, health is wealth.\r\n01.06.2022 23:52:20 - Justin: Agreed, Joseph.

But it takes practice and not all dreams are lucid.\r\n27.08.2024 10:07:15 - Nicholas: I see. I want to learn how to have lucid dreams. Any advice?\r\n27.08.2024 10:08:25 - Scharron: Well, it involves recognizing that you're dreaming while you're in the dream. A trick is to look for details that don't make sense in real life.\r\n27.08.2024 10:09:20 - Nicholas: That sounds challenging but fun.

I'll start - I love painting, it's my way of expressing my creativity and it relaxes me.\r\n05.08.2022 04:27:56 - Salik: That's cool, Sydney. I enjoy playing the guitar. I find it therapeutic.\r\n05.08.2022 04:29:30 - Aliyah: I didn't know that, Salik. I love baking. There's something satisfying about creating something tasty from scratch.\r\n05.08.2022 04:31:07 - Chester: Interesting hobbies everyone! I'm a big fan of hiking. Being in nature and the physical activity really clears my mind.\r\n05.08.2022 04:32:51 - Alex: Wow, we have some diverse interests here. Sydney, have you ever considered selling your paintings?\r\n05.08.2022 04:34:31 - Sydney: I've thought about it, Alex. But for now, I just enjoy doing it for myself. Salik, do you play in a band or just for fun?\r\n05.08.2022 04:35:29 - Salik: Just for fun, Sydney. But I do dream of performing on stage one day.\r\n05.08.2022 04:37:12 - Aliyah: That would be amazing, Salik. Chester, where's your favorite place to hike?\r\n05.08.2022 04:38:14 - Chester: I love hiking in the Rockies, Aliyah. The views are incredible.\r\n05.08.2022 04:38:55 - Alex: Those sound like great experiences. Let's make a pact to try out each other's hobbies sometime.\r\n05.08.2022 10:02:51 - Alex: Hey guys, have you seen the latest concert line-ups?\r\n05.08.2022 10:04:18 - Sydney: No, not yet. Who's performing?\r\n05.08.2022 10:05:49 - Salik: I heard that Coldplay is headlining.\r\n05.08.2022 10:06:23 - Aliyah: Really? I love Coldplay! When is it?\r\n05.08.2022 10:07:32 - Chester: It's on the 30th next month. We should all go.\r\n05.08.2022 10:09:05 - Alex: That sounds like a great idea. Let's do it.\r\n05.08.2022 10:09:40 - Sydney: I'm in! Let's buy the tickets tomorrow.\r\n05.08.2022 10:11:10 - Salik: Sounds like a plan. I'll check the prices.\r\n05.08.2022 10:12:13 - Aliyah: Great, let's meet at the coffee shop to plan this out.\r\n05.08.2022 10:12:56 - Chester: Perfect. See you guys tomorrow.\r\n05.08.2022 10:14:47 - Alex: Looking forward to it.\r\n05.08.2022 10:15:46 - Sydney: Me too. Can't wait!\r\n05.08.2022 10:17:00 - Salik: It's going to be fun.\r\n05.08.2022 10:17:52 - Aliyah: Definitely. Concerts are always fun with you guys.\r\n05.08.2022 10:18:50 - Chester: Couldn't agree more. See you all tomorrow.\r\n05.08.2022 14:00:00 - Alex: I've got a lead on the next mark. The Golden Griffin, it's called.\r\n05.08.2022 14:00:39 - Sydney: Sounds exotic. What's the story?\r\n05.08.2022 14:01:41 - Salik: It's a priceless artifact, last seen in the vault of a billionaire tycoon.\r\n05.08.2022 14:03:11 - Aliyah: Getting into that vault won't be easy. We'll need a solid plan.\r\n05.08.2022 14:04:25 - Chester: And the right tools. I can handle that part.\r\n05.08.2022 14:05:37 - Alex: Sydney, start gathering intel on the tycoon's security measures.\r\n05.08.2022 14:07:23 - Sydney: On it. Salik, let's touch base later. We need to map out the building.\r\n05.08.2022 14:08:28 - Salik: Agreed. Aliyah, can you work on possible escape routes?\r\n05.08.2022 14:10:12 - Aliyah: Sure thing. Chester, I'll need your help with that.\r\n05.08.2022 14:11:55 - Chester: No problem, Aliyah. We've got this.\r\n05.08.2022 14:13:30 - Alex: Let's meet tomorrow at dawn. Everyone knows their role.\r\n05.08.2022 14:14:41 - Sydney: See you all tomorrow. Stay safe.\r\n05.08.2022 14:15:22 - Salik: Good luck, everyone.\r\n05.08.2022 14:15:52 - Aliyah: We'll need it. See you tomorrow.\r\n05.08.2022 14:17:42 - Chester: Until then, team.\r\n05.08.2022 17:06:33 - Alex: Hey guys, did anyone watch the football game last night?\r\n05.08.2022 17:07:47 - Sydney: I did, it was quite intense. I can't believe they went into overtime!\r\n05.08.2022 17:09:31 - Salik: I missed it, had to work late. Who won in the end?\r\n05.08.2022 17:10:47 - Aliyah: The Tigers did. They scored a goal in the last minute. It was really exciting!\r\n05.08.2022 17:11:58 - Chester: I knew it! I bet on them. They've been playing really well this season.\r\n05.08.2022 17:13:58 - Alex: Chester, you're always lucky with your bets.\r\n05.08.2022 17:15:09 - Salik: Can someone tell me the final score?\r\n05.08.2022 17:16:18 - Sydney: It was 3-2 for the Tigers.\r\n05.08.2022 17:17:10 - Aliyah: Salik, you should really try to catch the next game. It's against the Hawks, it's going to be a good one.\r\n05.08.2022 17:18:42 - Chester: I agree with Aliyah. The Hawks are a tough team, it's going to be a great match.\r\n05.08.2022 17:20:06 - Alex: Let's all watch it together. Game night at my place?\r\n05.08.2022 17:22:01 - Sydney: Sounds good to me. What about you guys?\r\n05.08.2022 17:23:29 - Salik: I'm in. Thanks, Alex.\r\n05.08.2022 17:24:00 - Aliyah: Me too. Looking forward to it.\r\n05.08.2022 17:25:56 - Chester: Count me in. I'll bring the snacks.\r\n05.08.2022 18:27:40 - Alex: Hello everyone, have you ever thought about the concept of free will versus determinism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:28:42 - Sydney: That's a deep topic, Alex. I believe in determinism. Every action we take is a result of some previous action or event.\r\n05.08.2022 18:30:07 - Salik: Interesting Sydney, but I lean more towards free will. I think we have the power to make our own choices, independent of any predetermined path.\r\n05.08.2022 18:31:37 - Aliyah: I think it's a mix of both. Our surroundings and upbringing might shape us, but we still have the power to make decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:32:11 - Chester: Both views have merit, but I'm intrigued by the notion of compatibilism, which combines free will and determinism. It suggests that free will is compatible with determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:33:35 - Alex: That's a fascinating perspective, Chester. Can we dive deeper into compatibilism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:34:44 - Sydney: Sure, we can look at it in terms of cause and effect. Compatibilism suggests that our actions are both caused by previous events and also by our decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:36:34 - Salik: So, in essence, it's like saying although our choices are influenced, they're still our choices. That's a thought-provoking take.\r\n05.08.2022 18:38:18 - Aliyah: I like the idea of compatibilism. It seems to provide a balance between free will and determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:40:00 - Chester: Exactly, Aliyah. It's all about finding that balance. It's a complex topic, but worth exploring in depth.\r\n05.08.2022 19:34:49 - Alex: Hey guys, have you listened to the new album by The Weeknd?\r\n05.08.2022 19:35:20 - Sydney: Yeah, I did. His sound has really evolved, I love it!\r\n05.08.2022 19:36:13 - Salik: I haven't yet. Is it worth a listen?\r\n05.08.2022 19:36:45 - Aliyah: Definitely, Salik. He has really outdone himself this time.\r\n05.08.2022 19:37:53 - Chester: I'm more of a classic rock guy, but I'll give it a listen.\r\n05.08.2022 19:38:52 - Alex: That's the spirit, Chester. Music is all about exploring different genres.\r\n05.08.2022 19:40:45 - Sydney: True, Alex. By the way, has anyone been to a live concert recently?\r\n05.08.2022 19:42:43 - Salik: No, but I'm planning to attend the Jazz festival next month.\r\n05.08.2022 19:43:34 - Aliyah: That sounds exciting, Salik. I wish I could join.\r\n05.08.2022 19:45:34 - Chester: I attended a Metallica concert last year. It was epic!\n\nPlease, provide a short summary of each topic discussed in this conversation.

I'll bring the snacks.\r\n05.08.2022 18:27:40 - Alex: Hello everyone, have you ever thought about the concept of free will versus determinism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:28:42 - Sydney: That's a deep topic, Alex. I believe in determinism. Every action we take is a result of some previous action or event.\r\n05.08.2022 18:30:07 - Salik: Interesting Sydney, but I lean more towards free will. I think we have the power to make our own choices, independent of any predetermined path.\r\n05.08.2022 18:31:37 - Aliyah: I think it's a mix of both. Our surroundings and upbringing might shape us, but we still have the power to make decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:32:11 - Chester: Both views have merit, but I'm intrigued by the notion of compatibilism, which combines free will and determinism. It suggests that free will is compatible with determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:33:35 - Alex: That's a fascinating perspective, Chester. Can we dive deeper into compatibilism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:34:44 - Sydney: Sure, we can look at it in terms of cause and effect. Compatibilism suggests that our actions are both caused by previous events and also by our decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:36:34 - Salik: So, in essence, it's like saying although our choices are influenced, they're still our choices. That's a thought-provoking take.\r\n05.08.2022 18:38:18 - Aliyah: I like the idea of compatibilism. It seems to provide a balance between free will and determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:40:00 - Chester: Exactly, Aliyah. It's all about finding that balance. It's a complex topic, but worth exploring in depth.\r\n05.08.2022 19:34:49 - Alex: Hey guys, have you listened to the new album by The Weeknd?\r\n05.08.2022 19:35:20 - Sydney: Yeah, I did. His sound has really evolved, I love it!\r\n05.08.2022 19:36:13 - Salik: I haven't yet. Is it worth a listen?\r\n05.08.2022 19:36:45 - Aliyah: Definitely, Salik. He has really outdone himself this time.\r\n05.08.2022 19:37:53 - Chester: I'm more of a classic rock guy, but I'll give it a listen.\r\n05.08.2022 19:38:52 - Alex: That's the spirit, Chester. Music is all about exploring different genres.\r\n05.08.2022 19:40:45 - Sydney: True, Alex. By the way, has anyone been to a live concert recently?\r\n05.08.2022 19:42:43 - Salik: No, but I'm planning to attend the Jazz festival next month.\r\n05.08.2022 19:43:34 - Aliyah: That sounds exciting, Salik.

It suggests that free will is compatible with determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:33:35 - Alex: That's a fascinating perspective, Chester. Can we dive deeper into compatibilism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:34:44 - Sydney: Sure, we can look at it in terms of cause and effect. Compatibilism suggests that our actions are both caused by previous events and also by our decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:36:34 - Salik: So, in essence, it's like saying although our choices are influenced, they're still our choices. That's a thought-provoking take.\r\n05.08.2022 18:38:18 - Aliyah: I like the idea of compatibilism. It seems to provide a balance between free will and determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:40:00 - Chester: Exactly, Aliyah. It's all about finding that balance. It's a complex topic, but worth exploring in depth.\r\n05.08.2022 19:34:49 - Alex: Hey guys, have you listened to the new album by The Weeknd?\r\n05.08.2022 19:35:20 - Sydney: Yeah, I did. His sound has really evolved, I love it!\r\n05.08.2022 19:36:13 - Salik: I haven't yet. Is it worth a listen?\r\n05.08.2022 19:36:45 - Aliyah: Definitely, Salik. He has really outdone himself this time.\r\n05.08.2022 19:37:53 - Chester: I'm more of a classic rock guy, but I'll give it a listen.\r\n05.08.2022 19:38:52 - Alex: That's the spirit, Chester. Music is all about exploring different genres.\r\n05.08.2022 19:40:45 - Sydney: True, Alex. By the way, has anyone been to a live concert recently?\r\n05.08.2022 19:42:43 - Salik: No, but I'm planning to attend the Jazz festival next month.\r\n05.08.2022 19:43:34 - Aliyah: That sounds exciting, Salik. I wish I could join.\r\n05.08.2022 19:45:34 - Chester: I attended a Metallica concert last year. It was epic!\n\nPlease, provide a short summary of each topic discussed in this conversation.

Also, have you decided on a topic for the History project?\r\n16.12.2021 01:08:45 - Brent: Not yet, any suggestions?\r\n16.12.2021 01:10:08 - Mae: What about the French Revolution? I think we can find a lot of resources on it.\r\n16.12.2021 01:11:32 - Brent: Sounds good to me. Let\u2019s start researching tomorrow after we review the math homework.\r\n16.12.2021 01:13:13 - Mae: Perfect! See you tomorrow, Brent.\r\n16.12.2021 01:14:22 - Brent: See you, Mae.\r\n16.12.2021 04:38:00 - Mae: Hey Brent! I had the weirdest dream last night.\r\n16.12.2021 04:38:32 - Brent: Really? What happened?\r\n16.12.2021 04:39:37 - Mae: I was flying over a city full of skyscrapers, it was so real.\r\n16.12.2021 04:41:16 - Brent: That's cool! Do you often have dreams where you're flying?\r\n16.12.2021 04:43:16 - Mae: Not really, it's the first time. Do you believe dreams have meanings?\r\n16.12.2021 04:44:33 - Brent: Well, I think they can be influenced by our thoughts and experiences. For example, if you've been thinking about freedom or escape, that might explain the flying.\r\n16.12.2021 04:45:38 - Mae: That makes sense. I've been feeling quite stressed at work lately. Maybe I'm yearning for an escape.\r\n16.12.2021 04:46:51 - Brent: It's possible. Dreams can be a way for our subconscious to communicate with us.\r\n16.12.2021 04:47:58 - Mae: Do you remember your dreams often?\r\n16.12.2021 04:49:01 - Brent: Not always. But there are some dreams that I remember vividly, like the one where I was chased by a giant cookie.\r\n16.12.2021 04:50:00 - Mae: Ha! That sounds like a fun dream, unless you're scared of cookies.\r\n16.12.2021 04:51:24 - Brent: It was more amusing than scary. Anyway, it's interesting to analyze dreams, isn't it?\r\n16.12.2021 04:53:05 - Mae: Definitely! It gives us a glimpse into our subconscious mind.\r\n16.12.2021 04:54:02 - Brent: Yeah, I agree. Let's share more dreams next time.\r\n16.12.2021 04:56:00 - Mae: Sure thing, Brent. Goodnight for now.\r\n16.12.2021 10:26:36 - Mae: Hey Brent, have you seen the line-up for the upcoming music concert?\r\n16.12.2021 10:28:16 - Brent: Not yet, Mae.

When is it happening?\r\n16.12.2021 10:32:14 - Mae: It's on the 25th of next month. I was thinking of buying the tickets.\r\n16.12.2021 10:32:48 - Brent: Count me in, Mae. Let's do it!

How about a cat, Brody? They're more independent.\r\n12.04.2021 16:58:32 - Brody: I do like cats. But I'm also considering something a little more unconventional. Like a reptile.\r\n12.04.2021 17:00:23 - Eric: A reptile could be cool! Maybe a bearded dragon or a gecko?\r\n12.04.2021 17:01:18 - John: Reptiles are definitely unique pets. But remember they also have specific needs, like regulated temperatures.\r\n12.04.2021 17:02:17 - Brody: Yeah, I'll have to do some research. Thanks for the suggestions, guys.\r\n12.04.2021 17:02:49 - Eric: No problem, Brody. Let us know what you decide!\r\n12.04.2021 17:04:24 - John: Yeah, good luck with your decision, Brody!\r\n12.04.2021 20:48:21 - Brody: Hey guys, have you played the new Call of Duty yet?\r\n12.04.2021 20:49:57 - Eric: Not yet, Brody. I've been hooked on the new Assassin's Creed.\r\n12.04.2021 20:51:35 - John: I've been playing CoD non-stop. It's awesome, Eric, you have to try it!\r\n12.04.2021 20:52:28 - Eric: Really, John? What's so good about it?\r\n12.04.2021 20:53:05 - John: The graphics are insane and there's more strategy involved now. Plus, the new maps are really cool.\r\n12.04.2021 20:54:57 - Brody: I second John. The game play has really improved. Plus, there's a lot of new weapons.\r\n12.04.2021 20:56:35 - Eric: Sounds interesting. I'll try it out soon.\r\n12.04.2021 20:58:05 - John: Great!

The acting and storytelling are just top-notch.\r\n13.04.2021 02:01:28 - Eric: You guys are making me so curious.

The trailer looks promising.\r\n13.04.2021 02:05:49 - John: I must admit, I couldn't get into 'Stranger Things'.

It's a great show.\r\n13.04.2021 02:07:31 - Eric: Maybe we should organize a watch party for the new season's premiere.\r\n13.04.2021 02:08:58 - John: That sounds like a great idea, Eric!\r\n13.04.2021 02:09:35 - Brody: I'm in!

How about a cat, Brody? They're more independent.\r\n12.04.2021 16:58:32 - Brody: I do like cats. But I'm also considering something a little more unconventional. Like a reptile.\r\n12.04.2021 17:00:23 - Eric: A reptile could be cool! Maybe a bearded dragon or a gecko?\r\n12.04.2021 17:01:18 - John: Reptiles are definitely unique pets. But remember they also have specific needs, like regulated temperatures.\r\n12.04.2021 17:02:17 - Brody: Yeah, I'll have to do some research. Thanks for the suggestions, guys.\r\n12.04.2021 17:02:49 - Eric: No problem, Brody. Let us know what you decide!\r\n12.04.2021 17:04:24 - John: Yeah, good luck with your decision, Brody!\r\n12.04.2021 20:48:21 - Brody: Hey guys, have you played the new Call of Duty yet?\r\n12.04.2021 20:49:57 - Eric: Not yet, Brody. I've been hooked on the new Assassin's Creed.\r\n12.04.2021 20:51:35 - John: I've been playing CoD non-stop. It's awesome, Eric, you have to try it!\r\n12.04.2021 20:52:28 - Eric: Really, John? What's so good about it?\r\n12.04.2021 20:53:05 - John: The graphics are insane and there's more strategy involved now.

The new season is about to start.\r\n13.04.2021 02:04:48 - Eric: Oh, I can't wait for that! The trailer looks promising.\r\n13.04.2021 02:05:49 - John: I must admit, I couldn't get into 'Stranger Things'. Maybe I should give it another try.\r\n13.04.2021 02:06:33 - Brody: Yes, you should, John! It's a great show.\r\n13.04.2021 02:07:31 - Eric: Maybe we should organize a watch party for the new season's premiere.\r\n13.04.2021 02:08:58 - John: That sounds like a great idea, Eric!\r\n13.04.2021 02:09:35 - Brody: I'm in!

Like a reptile.\r\n12.04.2021 17:00:23 - Eric: A reptile could be cool! Maybe a bearded dragon or a gecko?\r\n12.04.2021 17:01:18 - John: Reptiles are definitely unique pets. But remember they also have specific needs, like regulated temperatures.\r\n12.04.2021 17:02:17 - Brody: Yeah, I'll have to do some research. Thanks for the suggestions, guys.\r\n12.04.2021 17:02:49 - Eric: No problem, Brody. Let us know what you decide!\r\n12.04.2021 17:04:24 - John: Yeah, good luck with your decision, Brody!\r\n12.04.2021 20:48:21 - Brody: Hey guys, have you played the new Call of Duty yet?\r\n12.04.2021 20:49:57 - Eric: Not yet, Brody. I've been hooked on the new Assassin's Creed.\r\n12.04.2021 20:51:35 - John: I've been playing CoD non-stop. It's awesome, Eric, you have to try it!\r\n12.04.2021 20:52:28 - Eric: Really, John? What's so good about it?\r\n12.04.2021 20:53:05 - John: The graphics are insane and there's more strategy involved now. Plus, the new maps are really cool.\r\n12.04.2021 20:54:57 - Brody: I second John. The game play has really improved. Plus, there's a lot of new weapons.\r\n12.04.2021 20:56:35 - Eric: Sounds interesting. I'll try it out soon.\r\n12.04.2021 20:58:05 - John: Great! Let's plan a game night soon.\r\n12.04.2021 20:59:26 - Brody: I'm in. Let's do this.\r\n13.04.2021 01:55:12 - Brody: Hey guys, have you seen the latest episode of 'The Crown'?\r\n13.04.2021 01:56:59 - Eric: No, not yet. But I've heard it's really good!\r\n13.04.2021 01:58:25 - John: I've seen it! I think this might be the best season yet.\r\n13.04.2021 01:59:54 - Brody: I agree, John. The acting and storytelling are just top-notch.\r\n13.04.2021 02:01:28 - Eric: You guys are making me so curious. I'm definitely watching it tonight.\r\n13.04.2021 02:02:13 - John: You won't regret it, Eric!\r\n13.04.2021 02:03:27 - Brody: And what about 'Stranger Things'? The new season is about to start.\r\n13.04.2021 02:04:48 - Eric: Oh, I can't wait for that! The trailer looks promising.\r\n13.04.2021 02:05:49 - John: I must admit, I couldn't get into 'Stranger Things'. Maybe I should give it another try.\r\n13.04.2021 02:06:33 - Brody: Yes, you should, John! It's a great show.\r\n13.04.2021 02:07:31 - Eric: Maybe we should organize a watch party for the new season's premiere.\r\n13.04.2021 02:08:58 - John: That sounds like a great idea, Eric!\r\n13.04.2021 02:09:35 - Brody: I'm in!

But still has that classic Marvel humor.\r\n12.04.2022 14:01:41 - Thomas: Sounds interesting. I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the recommendation.\r\n12.04.2022 14:02:39 - David: No problem. Let me know what you think when you see it.\r\n12.04.2022 14:04:05 - Thomas: Sure, I'll do that. By the way, have you seen the new Star Wars movie?\r\n12.04.2022 14:05:19 - David: Yes, I have.

Do you have any favorite composers or pieces yet?\r\n12.04.2022 16:01:12 - David: I've mainly been listening to Beethoven. His Moonlight Sonata is simply beautiful\r\n12.04.2022 16:02:20 - Thomas: I completely agree. Beethoven's work is timeless. I'd also recommend Mozart if you're looking to explore more\r\n12.04.2022 16:04:05 - David: Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check out some of Mozart's works. Do you play any instruments?\r\n12.04.2022 16:05:31 - Thomas: I used to play the piano when I was younger. Nowadays, I just enjoy listening to good music\r\n12.04.2022 16:06:54 - David: That's cool! I've been thinking about learning the guitar. Any tips?\r\n12.04.2022 16:07:26 - Thomas: That's a great choice! Just be patient with yourself and practice regularly.

In what way?\r\n12.04.2022 17:13:49 - David: I was just wondering if there is a specific reason we dream about certain things.\r\n12.04.2022 17:14:47 - Thomas: I think dreams are a reflection of our subconscious mind. They can be influenced by our day-to-day experiences, thoughts, and feelings.\r\n12.04.2022 17:16:28 - David: Interesting. Have you ever had a recurring dream?\r\n12.04.2022 17:17:18 - Thomas: Yes, I have. It was a strange one where I was flying above a city. \r\n12.04.2022 17:18:03 - David: That sounds fascinating. Do you think it had any specific meaning?\r\n12.04.2022 17:18:48 - Thomas: It's hard to say for sure. But I think it might have represented a desire for freedom and exploration.\r\n12.04.2022 17:20:03 - David: That's a great interpretation. It's amazing how our minds work, isn't it?\r\n12.04.2022 17:21:37 - Thomas: It sure is, David. The human mind is truly fascinating.\r\n12.04.2022 22:33:42 - David: Hey Thomas, how's the weather looking on your end?\r\n12.04.2022 22:35:12 - Thomas: Hi David, it's quite sunny here. How about at your place?\r\n12.04.2022 22:35:50 - David: It's quite gloomy here. Looks like it's going to rain.\r\n12.04.2022 22:37:50 - Thomas: Oh, that's quite the contrast. Make sure to carry an umbrella if you're heading out.\r\n12.04.2022 22:39:46 - David: Will do, Thomas. Hopefully, it clears up soon.\r\n12.04.2022 22:41:29 - Thomas: Fingers crossed, David.

Let me know what you think when you see it.\r\n12.04.2022 14:04:05 - Thomas: Sure, I'll do that. By the way, have you seen the new Star Wars movie?\r\n12.04.2022 14:05:19 - David: Yes, I have.

Do you have any favorite composers or pieces yet?\r\n12.04.2022 16:01:12 - David: I've mainly been listening to Beethoven. His Moonlight Sonata is simply beautiful\r\n12.04.2022 16:02:20 - Thomas: I completely agree. Beethoven's work is timeless. I'd also recommend Mozart if you're looking to explore more\r\n12.04.2022 16:04:05 - David: Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check out some of Mozart's works. Do you play any instruments?\r\n12.04.2022 16:05:31 - Thomas: I used to play the piano when I was younger. Nowadays, I just enjoy listening to good music\r\n12.04.2022 16:06:54 - David: That's cool! I've been thinking about learning the guitar. Any tips?\r\n12.04.2022 16:07:26 - Thomas: That's a great choice! Just be patient with yourself and practice regularly. It'll come to you eventually\r\n12.04.2022 16:09:11 - David: Thanks for the advice, Thomas.

In what way?\r\n12.04.2022 17:13:49 - David: I was just wondering if there is a specific reason we dream about certain things.\r\n12.04.2022 17:14:47 - Thomas: I think dreams are a reflection of our subconscious mind. They can be influenced by our day-to-day experiences, thoughts, and feelings.\r\n12.04.2022 17:16:28 - David: Interesting. Have you ever had a recurring dream?\r\n12.04.2022 17:17:18 - Thomas: Yes, I have. It was a strange one where I was flying above a city. \r\n12.04.2022 17:18:03 - David: That sounds fascinating. Do you think it had any specific meaning?\r\n12.04.2022 17:18:48 - Thomas: It's hard to say for sure. But I think it might have represented a desire for freedom and exploration.\r\n12.04.2022 17:20:03 - David: That's a great interpretation. It's amazing how our minds work, isn't it?\r\n12.04.2022 17:21:37 - Thomas: It sure is, David. The human mind is truly fascinating.\r\n12.04.2022 22:33:42 - David: Hey Thomas, how's the weather looking on your end?\r\n12.04.2022 22:35:12 - Thomas: Hi David, it's quite sunny here. How about at your place?\r\n12.04.2022 22:35:50 - David: It's quite gloomy here. Looks like it's going to rain.\r\n12.04.2022 22:37:50 - Thomas: Oh, that's quite the contrast. Make sure to carry an umbrella if you're heading out.\r\n12.04.2022 22:39:46 - David: Will do, Thomas. Hopefully, it clears up soon.\r\n12.04.2022 22:41:29 - Thomas: Fingers crossed, David.

The Perseverance Rover, right?\r\n21.03.2022 00:55:42 - Greyson: That's correct, Kenneth. It's really impressive how far we've come in space exploration.\r\n21.03.2022 00:56:16 - Robert: I agree, Greyson. It's fascinating to think about what we might discover next.\r\n21.03.2022 00:57:20 - Chris: It's also a testament to human ingenuity and perseverance. No pun intended!\r\n21.03.2022 00:58:54 - Kenneth: Haha good one, Chris. But yes, it's truly inspiring.\r\n21.03.2022 01:00:53 - Greyson: Did you guys know that the rover will also be looking for signs of past microbial life?\r\n21.03.2022 01:02:15 - Robert: Really? That's amazing. Imagine if we found evidence of life on Mars.\r\n21.03.2022 01:04:13 - Chris: That would be a game-changer. It would make us rethink our place in the universe.\r\n21.03.2022 01:04:48 - Kenneth: Indeed. It's an exciting time to be alive!\r\n21.03.2022 01:05:22 - Greyson: Absolutely.

Homeschooling the kids is not an easy task.\r\n21.03.2022 02:46:31 - Greyson: Tell me about it, Kenneth. I'm running out of ideas to keep the kids entertained.\r\n21.03.2022 02:48:00 - Robert: I'm lucky that my kids are all grown up. But, I miss my grandchildren. Can't wait to see them.\r\n21.03.2022 02:49:28 - Chris: I feel you, Robert. It's been tough on all of us. Let's hope things get better soon.\r\n21.03.2022 02:50:12 - Kenneth: Yeah, let's stay positive. We're all in this together.\r\n21.03.2022 02:51:25 - Greyson: Agreed. Let's also plan a virtual get-together for the kids.\r\n21.03.2022 02:53:20 - Robert: That sounds like a great idea, Greyson. Let's do it.\r\n21.03.2022 06:08:54 - Chris: Hey guys, have you seen the latest Marvel movie?\r\n21.03.2022 06:09:39 - Kenneth: No, not yet.

Marvel never disappoints.\r\n21.03.2022 06:13:45 - Robert: I've seen it. And yes, it's fantastic. The visual effects are superb!\r\n21.03.2022 06:14:27 - Kenneth: Okay, you guys convinced me. I'll watch it this weekend.\r\n21.03.2022 06:14:57 - Greyson: You won't regret it, Kenneth.\r\n21.03.2022 06:16:27 - Robert: By the way, do you guys have any other movie recommendations?\r\n21.03.2022 06:17:19 - Chris: I recently watched a movie called 'Inception'. It's a bit old but it's really good.\r\n21.03.2022 06:18:07 - Kenneth: Inception is a masterpiece! One of my all-time favorites.\r\n21.03.2022 06:19:01 - Greyson: I second that. Inception is a classic. Definitely worth a rewatch.\r\n21.03.2022 06:20:36 - Robert: I've never watched it, but I'll definitely give it a go.

Robert is worried because the project is not legal, and Kenneth wonders how to get the email list. Greyson states that he knows someone who could get the list. Robert stresses again that it is illegal, and Chris replies that it is okay if they do not get caught. They then all resign due to the related risk, including Chris, who states that he will find something else.",

It's a bit old but it's really good.\r\n21.03.2022 06:18:07 - Kenneth: Inception is a masterpiece! One of my all-time favorites.\r\n21.03.2022 06:19:01 - Greyson: I second that.

The last-minute goal was a total surprise.\r\n21.06.2022 08:24:47 - Karen: Definitely! I thought we were going into overtime.\r\n21.06.2022 08:26:40 - Helen: Me too.

I just finished reading \"The Silent Patient\". It was an amazing psychological thriller!\r\n21.06.2022 12:13:45 - Helen: Oh, I've heard about that one. It's by Alex Michaelides, right?\r\n21.06.2022 12:15:03 - Karen: Yes, that's the one. I couldn't put it down, the plot twists were so unexpected!\r\n21.06.2022 12:16:12 - Helen: That sounds like a book I would enjoy. I love thrillers with unexpected plot twists.\r\n21.06.2022 12:17:27 - Karen: Then you should definitely give it a try. What are you currently reading?\r\n21.06.2022 12:18:04 - Helen: I'm reading \"Educated\" by Tara Westover. It's a memoir and it's really gripping!\r\n21.06.2022 12:19:46 - Karen: Oh, I read that last year. It's an incredibly inspiring story.\r\n21.06.2022 12:20:44 - Helen: It really is. Tara's journey is so powerful and moving.\r\n21.06.2022 12:22:42 - Karen: Let's make a book club! We can share and discuss books we've read.\r\n21.06.2022 12:24:34 - Helen: That's a great idea Karen! I'm in. Let's do it.\r\n21.06.2022 16:34:22 - Helen: Hey Karen, we need to discuss our next steps.\r\n21.06.2022 16:35:02 - Karen: I agree, Helen.

Any ideas?\r\n21.06.2022 16:37:26 - Karen: I've found a potential place. It's an old barn, secluded and not in use.\r\n21.06.2022 16:38:44 - Helen: Sounds good. We need to ensure it has the necessary power supply.\r\n21.06.2022 16:39:36 - Karen: Already checked, it's perfect for our needs.\r\n21.06.2022 16:41:03 - Helen: Great. Let's plan a visit to check it out in person.\r\n21.06.2022 16:41:56 - Karen: Agreed. We should also think about security measures.\r\n21.06.2022 16:43:53 - Helen: Absolutely. We can't afford any unexpected surprises.\r\n21.06.2022 16:45:11 - Karen: I'll contact our guy about the security then.\r\n21.06.2022 16:46:31 - Helen: Perfect.

I'm planning to visit a few next month.\r\n21.06.2022 19:42:26 - Helen: That's a good idea. It will give you a feel of the environment.\r\n21.06.2022 19:43:19 - Karen: Yeah, I hope so. I'm also trying to understand the financial aspects.\r\n21.06.2022 19:44:20 - Helen: That's important too. You might want to look at scholarship options.\r\n21.06.2022 19:45:52 - Karen: Definitely. I'm also looking at student loan options just in case.\r\n21.06.2022 19:46:51 - Helen: Do you need any help? I can share some resources.\r\n21.06.2022 19:48:36 - Karen: That would be great, Helen. I appreciate it.\r\n21.06.2022 19:50:07 - Helen: No problem, Karen. We're in this together.\r\n21.06.2022 19:50:47 - Karen: Thanks, Helen.

Any ideas?\r\n21.06.2022 16:37:26 - Karen: I've found a potential place. It's an old barn, secluded and not in use.\r\n21.06.2022 16:38:44 - Helen: Sounds good. We need to ensure it has the necessary power supply.\r\n21.06.2022 16:39:36 - Karen: Already checked, it's perfect for our needs.\r\n21.06.2022 16:41:03 - Helen: Great. Let's plan a visit to check it out in person.\r\n21.06.2022 16:41:56 - Karen: Agreed. We should also think about security measures.\r\n21.06.2022 16:43:53 - Helen: Absolutely. We can't afford any unexpected surprises.\r\n21.06.2022 16:45:11 - Karen: I'll contact our guy about the security then.\r\n21.06.2022 16:46:31 - Helen: Perfect. Let's keep this operation as discrete as possible.\r\n21.06.2022 16:48:14 - Karen: Absolutely, Helen. We can't afford any slip-ups.\r\n21.06.2022 19:34:28 - Helen: Hey Karen, how's the college search going?\r\n21.06.2022 19:35:33 - Karen: Hi Helen, it's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. There are so many options!\r\n21.06.2022 19:37:18 - Helen: I know right! It's hard to decide which one is the best fit.\r\n21.06.2022 19:38:28 - Karen: Exactly. I'm looking at the course offerings, faculty, location, everything.\r\n21.06.2022 19:39:39 - Helen: Have you visited any campuses yet?\r\n21.06.2022 19:40:34 - Karen: Not yet. I'm planning to visit a few next month.\r\n21.06.2022 19:42:26 - Helen: That's a good idea. It will give you a feel of the environment.\r\n21.06.2022 19:43:19 - Karen: Yeah, I hope so. I'm also trying to understand the financial aspects.\r\n21.06.2022 19:44:20 - Helen: That's important too. You might want to look at scholarship options.\r\n21.06.2022 19:45:52 - Karen: Definitely. I'm also looking at student loan options just in case.\r\n21.06.2022 19:46:51 - Helen: Do you need any help? I can share some resources.\r\n21.06.2022 19:48:36 - Karen: That would be great, Helen. I appreciate it.\r\n21.06.2022 19:50:07 - Helen: No problem, Karen. We're in this together.\r\n21.06.2022 19:50:47 - Karen: Thanks, Helen.

They can be annoying, but I love them.\r\n24.08.2021 03:33:32 - Teegan: I always wished I had a sibling growing up.\r\n24.08.2021 03:34:40 - Kim: Well, we are kind of like a family here, aren't we?\r\n24.08.2021 04:46:30 - Parker: Hey guys, how's the weather where you all are?\r\n24.08.2021 04:47:06 - April: It's pretty cold over here in New York. Snowed a little this morning.\r\n24.08.2021 04:48:22 - Alexander: Nice and sunny in California. Couldn't ask for better weather.\r\n24.08.2021 04:50:02 - Teegan: It's raining cats and dogs here in London. Wish I was in California right now!\r\n24.08.2021 04:51:52 - Kim: It's windy here in Chicago. The Windy City living up to its name.\r\n24.08.2021 04:53:02 - Parker: Sounds like we're all experiencing different weather conditions.\r\n24.08.2021 04:54:17 - April: I wish I was experiencing Alexander's weather right now. I miss the sun.\r\n24.08.2021 04:55:37 - Alexander: Well, I wouldn't mind a bit of snow. We rarely get that here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:57:03 - Teegan: I would trade the rain for snow any day. It's been so gloomy here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:58:44 - Kim: And I wouldn't mind a bit of rain. It would be a nice change from the wind.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:15 - Parker: Maybe we should all swap places for a bit.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:50 - April: That sounds like a great idea, Parker.\r\n24.08.2021 05:01:44 - Alexander: I'm in.

I could use a bit of snow in my life.\r\n24.08.2021 06:19:01 - Parker: Hey guys, have you started looking into your college applications yet?\r\n24.08.2021 06:20:39 - April: Yeah, I'm so overwhelmed. There are so many options.\r\n24.08.2021 06:22:24 - Alexander: I've narrowed down my choices to a few universities. Now, it's all about writing the perfect application.\r\n24.08.2021 06:23:09 - Teegan: I'm stuck on the essay part. How do you even begin to write about 'a significant experience in your life?'\r\n24.08.2021 06:24:04 - Kim: Maybe start by brainstorming some key moments that had a big impact on you, Teegan.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:10 - Parker: That's a good idea, Kim. And remember, it doesn't have to be something huge. It could be something small that changed your perspective.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:46 - April: I'm also struggling with financial aid. The forms are so confusing.\r\n24.08.2021 06:26:32 - Alexander: I can help with that, April. I've been through it with my older sister.\r\n24.08.2021 06:27:25 - Teegan: That would be great, Alexander. Maybe we can all meet up this weekend to work on our applications together.\r\n24.08.2021 06:29:09 - Kim: That sounds like a plan. Let's do it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:33:38 - Parker: Hey guys, have you tried that new Italian place downtown?\r\n24.08.2021 11:34:58 - April: No, but I've heard good things! What's it called again?\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:16 - Parker: It's called 'La Trattoria'. Really authentic Italian food.\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:57 - Alexander: I'm in! Always up for trying new food spots.\r\n24.08.2021 11:38:19 - Teegan: Sounds great! We should plan a night to go together.\r\n24.08.2021 11:39:14 - Kim: I've been there, the pasta is amazing!\r\n24.08.2021 11:40:50 - April: Okay, I'm sold. Let's do this.\r\n24.08.2021 11:41:24 - Alexander: How about next Friday?\r\n24.08.2021 11:42:27 - Teegan: Works for me.\r\n24.08.2021 11:43:06 - Kim: I'm in too.\r\n24.08.2021 11:44:28 - Parker: Perfect, I'll make a reservation for 5 next Friday.\r\n24.08.2021 11:45:50 - April: Great! Looking forward to it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:46:34 - Alexander: Same here. Can't wait!\r\n24.08.2021 11:47:21 - Teegan: See you guys then!\r\n24.08.2021 11:49:13 - Kim: Excited for some delicious pasta!\r\n24.08.2021 14:30:00 - Parker: Guys, I think we need to discuss the new formula for the product\r\n24.08.2021 14:32:00 - April: Absolutely. We've been getting feedback that the quality isn't as high as it used to be\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:02 - Alexander: That's a big issue. Any problem with the ingredients?\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:48 - Teegan: As far as I can tell, the ingredients are fine. The issue might be in the process\r\n24.08.2021 14:34:25 - Kim: I agree with Teegan. It's not the what, it's the how. We should revisit our process\r\n24.08.2021 14:35:11 - Parker: That's a good point, Kim. We need to ensure we're not cutting corners\r\n24.08.2021 14:36:09 - April: We also need to think about security. The last thing we want is for this operation to get busted\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:04 - Alexander: I've got contacts that can help with securing the operation\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:40 - Teegan: Let's focus on the process first, then we'll sort out security\r\n24.08.2021 14:40:11 - Kim: Agreed.

The forms are so confusing.\r\n24.08.2021 06:26:32 - Alexander: I can help with that, April. I've been through it with my older sister.\r\n24.08.2021 06:27:25 - Teegan: That would be great, Alexander. Maybe we can all meet up this weekend to work on our applications together.\r\n24.08.2021 06:29:09 - Kim: That sounds like a plan. Let's do it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:33:38 - Parker: Hey guys, have you tried that new Italian place downtown?\r\n24.08.2021 11:34:58 - April: No, but I've heard good things! What's it called again?\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:16 - Parker: It's called 'La Trattoria'. Really authentic Italian food.\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:57 - Alexander: I'm in! Always up for trying new food spots.\r\n24.08.2021 11:38:19 - Teegan: Sounds great!

We've been getting feedback that the quality isn't as high as it used to be\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:02 - Alexander: That's a big issue. Any problem with the ingredients?\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:48 - Teegan: As far as I can tell, the ingredients are fine. The issue might be in the process\r\n24.08.2021 14:34:25 - Kim: I agree with Teegan. It's not the what, it's the how. We should revisit our process\r\n24.08.2021 14:35:11 - Parker: That's a good point, Kim. We need to ensure we're not cutting corners\r\n24.08.2021 14:36:09 - April: We also need to think about security. The last thing we want is for this operation to get busted\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:04 - Alexander: I've got contacts that can help with securing the operation\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:40 - Teegan: Let's focus on the process first, then we'll sort out security\r\n24.08.2021 14:40:11 - Kim: Agreed.

Always having to set an example and being responsible for the younger ones.\r\n24.08.2021 03:26:23 - Alexander: Funny, as the middle child, I feel like I'm always overlooked!\r\n24.08.2021 03:27:52 - Teegan: I can't relate at all, being an only child.\r\n24.08.2021 03:29:47 - Kim: As the youngest, I feel like I'm always treated like a baby.\r\n24.08.2021 03:30:32 - Parker: I guess it's tough no matter where you fall in the sibling order.\r\n24.08.2021 03:31:10 - April: Yeah, but at the end of the day, I wouldn't trade my siblings for anything.\r\n24.08.2021 03:31:42 - Alexander: Same here. They can be annoying, but I love them.\r\n24.08.2021 03:33:32 - Teegan: I always wished I had a sibling growing up.\r\n24.08.2021 03:34:40 - Kim: Well, we are kind of like a family here, aren't we?\r\n24.08.2021 04:46:30 - Parker: Hey guys, how's the weather where you all are?\r\n24.08.2021 04:47:06 - April: It's pretty cold over here in New York. Snowed a little this morning.\r\n24.08.2021 04:48:22 - Alexander: Nice and sunny in California. Couldn't ask for better weather.\r\n24.08.2021 04:50:02 - Teegan: It's raining cats and dogs here in London. Wish I was in California right now!\r\n24.08.2021 04:51:52 - Kim: It's windy here in Chicago. The Windy City living up to its name.\r\n24.08.2021 04:53:02 - Parker: Sounds like we're all experiencing different weather conditions.\r\n24.08.2021 04:54:17 - April: I wish I was experiencing Alexander's weather right now. I miss the sun.\r\n24.08.2021 04:55:37 - Alexander: Well, I wouldn't mind a bit of snow. We rarely get that here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:57:03 - Teegan: I would trade the rain for snow any day. It's been so gloomy here.\r\n24.08.2021 04:58:44 - Kim: And I wouldn't mind a bit of rain. It would be a nice change from the wind.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:15 - Parker: Maybe we should all swap places for a bit.\r\n24.08.2021 04:59:50 - April: That sounds like a great idea, Parker.\r\n24.08.2021 05:01:44 - Alexander: I'm in. Who wants to come to sunny California?\r\n24.08.2021 05:02:47 - Teegan: I'll swap with you, Alexander. You can have the London rain.\r\n24.08.2021 05:04:09 - Kim: And I'll swap with you, April. I could use a bit of snow in my life.\r\n24.08.2021 06:19:01 - Parker: Hey guys, have you started looking into your college applications yet?\r\n24.08.2021 06:20:39 - April: Yeah, I'm so overwhelmed. There are so many options.\r\n24.08.2021 06:22:24 - Alexander: I've narrowed down my choices to a few universities. Now, it's all about writing the perfect application.\r\n24.08.2021 06:23:09 - Teegan: I'm stuck on the essay part. How do you even begin to write about 'a significant experience in your life?'\r\n24.08.2021 06:24:04 - Kim: Maybe start by brainstorming some key moments that had a big impact on you, Teegan.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:10 - Parker: That's a good idea, Kim. And remember, it doesn't have to be something huge. It could be something small that changed your perspective.\r\n24.08.2021 06:25:46 - April: I'm also struggling with financial aid. The forms are so confusing.\r\n24.08.2021 06:26:32 - Alexander: I can help with that, April. I've been through it with my older sister.\r\n24.08.2021 06:27:25 - Teegan: That would be great, Alexander. Maybe we can all meet up this weekend to work on our applications together.\r\n24.08.2021 06:29:09 - Kim: That sounds like a plan. Let's do it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:33:38 - Parker: Hey guys, have you tried that new Italian place downtown?\r\n24.08.2021 11:34:58 - April: No, but I've heard good things! What's it called again?\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:16 - Parker: It's called 'La Trattoria'. Really authentic Italian food.\r\n24.08.2021 11:36:57 - Alexander: I'm in! Always up for trying new food spots.\r\n24.08.2021 11:38:19 - Teegan: Sounds great! We should plan a night to go together.\r\n24.08.2021 11:39:14 - Kim: I've been there, the pasta is amazing!\r\n24.08.2021 11:40:50 - April: Okay, I'm sold. Let's do this.\r\n24.08.2021 11:41:24 - Alexander: How about next Friday?\r\n24.08.2021 11:42:27 - Teegan: Works for me.\r\n24.08.2021 11:43:06 - Kim: I'm in too.\r\n24.08.2021 11:44:28 - Parker: Perfect, I'll make a reservation for 5 next Friday.\r\n24.08.2021 11:45:50 - April: Great! Looking forward to it.\r\n24.08.2021 11:46:34 - Alexander: Same here. Can't wait!\r\n24.08.2021 11:47:21 - Teegan: See you guys then!\r\n24.08.2021 11:49:13 - Kim: Excited for some delicious pasta!\r\n24.08.2021 14:30:00 - Parker: Guys, I think we need to discuss the new formula for the product\r\n24.08.2021 14:32:00 - April: Absolutely. We've been getting feedback that the quality isn't as high as it used to be\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:02 - Alexander: That's a big issue. Any problem with the ingredients?\r\n24.08.2021 14:33:48 - Teegan: As far as I can tell, the ingredients are fine. The issue might be in the process\r\n24.08.2021 14:34:25 - Kim: I agree with Teegan. It's not the what, it's the how. We should revisit our process\r\n24.08.2021 14:35:11 - Parker: That's a good point, Kim. We need to ensure we're not cutting corners\r\n24.08.2021 14:36:09 - April: We also need to think about security. The last thing we want is for this operation to get busted\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:04 - Alexander: I've got contacts that can help with securing the operation\r\n24.08.2021 14:38:40 - Teegan: Let's focus on the process first, then we'll sort out security\r\n24.08.2021 14:40:11 - Kim: Agreed.

I've been chilling at home, watching some series. Any plans for Sunday?\r\n31.07.2022 21:12:34 - Manuel: Yes, I plan to visit a museum. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n31.07.2022 21:13:41 - Falon: You should check out the art museum downtown. They have a new exhibition.\r\n31.07.2022 21:15:07 - Manuel: That sounds interesting. Will definitely check it out. Thanks, Falon!\r\n31.07.2022 21:17:03 - Falon: No problem! Enjoy your visit. Let's catch up next week.\r\n31.07.2022 21:18:15 - Manuel: Sure, sounds like a plan.

I think it's really good, especially the song \"Coloratura\".\r\n31.07.2022 23:20:56 - Falon: I agree, \"Coloratura\" is my favorite too. I also loved their collaboration with BTS.\r\n31.07.2022 23:21:56 - Manuel: Yes, that was quite unexpected. But the song \"My Universe\" turned out to be a great blend of two different styles.\r\n31.07.2022 23:23:39 - Falon: Exactly. It's like a perfect fusion of pop and rock. What other genres do you listen to?\r\n31.07.2022 23:24:23 - Manuel: I'm a big fan of jazz and blues. Recently, I've been listening to a lot of Miles Davis.\r\n31.07.2022 23:26:09 - Falon: Oh, Miles Davis is a legend. I personally love \"So What\". It's such a classic.\r\n31.07.2022 23:26:52 - Manuel: Yes, \"So What\" is a masterpiece. Do you play any instruments?\r\n31.07.2022 23:28:06 - Falon: I'm learning to play the guitar. I hope to play like Eric Clapton one day.\r\n31.07.2022 23:28:51 - Manuel: That's cool. Keep practicing and you'll get there. Speaking of Clapton, have you heard his song \"Tears in Heaven\"?\r\n31.07.2022 23:30:40 - Falon: Yes, it's a beautiful song. It always makes me emotional.\r\n31.07.2022 23:31:42 - Manuel: Same here.

Music has such a powerful impact on our emotions.\r\n01.08.2022 02:54:34 - Falon: Hey Manuel, have you seen the latest episode of 'The Witcher' yet?\r\n01.08.2022 02:55:35 - Manuel: Hi Falon! Yes, I just finished watching it. It was thrilling!\r\n01.08.2022 02:57:25 - Falon: I know, right? The plot twists were unexpected!\r\n01.08.2022 02:58:24 - Manuel: Absolutely, especially the character development of Geralt. I am really impressed.\r\n01.08.2022 02:59:37 - Falon: Me too! I can't wait for the next episode. Do you have any other series to recommend?\r\n01.08.2022 03:01:00 - Manuel: Yes, I just started watching 'Stranger Things'. It's really good so far.\r\n01.08.2022 03:02:04 - Falon: I've heard a lot about it. What's it about?\r\n01.08.2022 03:03:14 - Manuel: It's a sci-fi horror series. It's about a group of kids in a small town who encounter supernatural phenomena.\r\n01.08.2022 03:04:02 - Falon: Sounds intriguing! I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!\r\n01.08.2022 03:05:29 - Manuel: No problem! Let me know what you think about it.\r\n01.08.2022 03:07:06 - Falon: Sure, I will.

How about you?\r\n01.08.2022 06:08:25 - Falon: That's amazing! I love painting. I guess we both love art in different forms.\r\n01.08.2022 06:10:18 - Manuel: Yes, indeed. Do you have any of your paintings to share?\r\n01.08.2022 06:11:32 - Falon: Sure, I'd love to share some of my work with you.\r\n01.08.2022 06:13:11 - Manuel: That sounds great.

I couldn't put it down.\r\n01.08.2022 07:59:52 - Manuel: That sounds intriguing. What's the book about?\r\n01.08.2022 08:00:46 - Falon: It's a mystery novel with a touch of magic, just like her Harry Potter series but for adults.\r\n01.08.2022 08:02:30 - Manuel: Sounds interesting. I loved the Harry Potter series. I'll definitely check it out.\r\n01.08.2022 08:03:26 - Falon: Great! Let me know how you find it.\r\n01.08.2022 08:04:22 - Manuel: Will do. By the way, have you read 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?\r\n01.08.2022 08:05:36 - Falon: Yes, I have. It's a classic. I love how it addresses complex issues through the eyes of a child.\r\n01.08.2022 08:07:32 - Manuel: Exactly! It's one of my all-time favorite books.\r\n01.08.2022 08:08:12 - Falon: Mine too. It's beautifully written.\r\n01.08.2022 08:09:36 - Manuel: I couldn't agree more. Any other book recommendations?\r\n01.08.2022 08:10:46 - Falon: Sure, if you're into historical fiction, 'The Book Thief' is a must-read.\r\n01.08.2022 08:12:14 - Manuel: Thanks for the recommendation, Falon. I'll add it to my list.\r\n01.08.2022 11:09:53 - Falon: Hey Manuel! Have you heard about the upcoming concert next weekend?\r\n01.08.2022 11:11:14 - Manuel: Hi Falon! No, I haven't. Who's performing?\r\n01.08.2022 11:12:10 - Falon: It's Coldplay. They're back on tour and our city is one of their stops.\r\n01.08.2022 11:13:46 - Manuel: Wow! That sounds amazing.

But the song \"My Universe\" turned out to be a great blend of two different styles.\r\n31.07.2022 23:23:39 - Falon: Exactly. It's like a perfect fusion of pop and rock. What other genres do you listen to?\r\n31.07.2022 23:24:23 - Manuel: I'm a big fan of jazz and blues. Recently, I've been listening to a lot of Miles Davis.\r\n31.07.2022 23:26:09 - Falon: Oh, Miles Davis is a legend. I personally love \"So What\". It's such a classic.\r\n31.07.2022 23:26:52 - Manuel: Yes, \"So What\" is a masterpiece. Do you play any instruments?\r\n31.07.2022 23:28:06 - Falon: I'm learning to play the guitar. I hope to play like Eric Clapton one day.\r\n31.07.2022 23:28:51 - Manuel: That's cool. Keep practicing and you'll get there. Speaking of Clapton, have you heard his song \"Tears in Heaven\"?\r\n31.07.2022 23:30:40 - Falon: Yes, it's a beautiful song. It always makes me emotional.\r\n31.07.2022 23:31:42 - Manuel: Same here. It's one of those songs that touches your soul.\r\n31.07.2022 23:32:17 - Falon: I totally agree. Music has such a powerful impact on our emotions.\r\n01.08.2022 02:54:34 - Falon: Hey Manuel, have you seen the latest episode of 'The Witcher' yet?\r\n01.08.2022 02:55:35 - Manuel: Hi Falon!

How often do you go?\r\n26.06.2021 05:32:48 - Brandon: I try to go at least three times a week.\r\n26.06.2021 05:33:43 - Joshua: I've been thinking about starting yoga.

It has a catchy tune.\r\n23.03.2022 16:41:10 - Tiana: That's true. It's one of those songs that you can't get out of your head.\r\n23.03.2022 16:42:00 - Robert: Do you think this album will win any awards?\r\n23.03.2022 16:42:34 - Tiana: It's hard to say.

Thanks Robert.\r\n23.03.2022 10:37:32 - Robert: You're welcome. Enjoy!\r\n23.03.2022 10:38:13 - Tiana: I'm sure I will. Chat later, Robert.\r\n23.03.2022 10:39:37 - Robert: Bye Tiana, talk to you soon.\r\n23.03.2022 11:36:18 - Robert: Hey Tiana, how's the college application process going?\r\n23.03.2022 11:37:39 - Tiana: Hey Robert! It's going alright. Just sorting through various colleges.\r\n23.03.2022 11:39:19 - Robert: That's cool. Any favorites yet?\r\n23.03.2022 11:40:04 - Tiana: Well, I've been looking at Stanford and Harvard so far.\r\n23.03.2022 11:40:55 - Robert: Wow, those are great choices! What major are you considering?\r\n23.03.2022 11:42:52 - Tiana: I'm thinking about computer science. But I also love biochemistry.\r\n23.03.2022 11:44:36 - Robert: That's interesting. You know, you can always do a double major or choose one as a minor.\r\n23.03.2022 11:46:01 - Tiana: Yeah, that's true. Just trying to figure out what would be the best fit for me.\r\n23.03.2022 11:47:15 - Robert: You'll figure it out. What about the deadlines? Are they coming up soon?\r\n23.03.2022 11:49:13 - Tiana: Yes, they are. I'm working on my essays now.\r\n23.03.2022 11:50:28 - Robert: If you need any help or someone to proofread, let me know!\r\n23.03.2022 11:51:52 - Tiana: Thanks, Robert! I might take you up on that.\r\n23.03.2022 11:53:29 - Robert: No problem, Tiana. Good luck with everything!\r\n23.03.2022 11:55:03 - Tiana: Thanks, Robert! I'll keep you updated.\r\n23.03.2022 11:56:45 - Robert: Sure, looking forward to it!\r\n23.03.2022 16:34:05 - Robert: Hey Tiana, have you listened to the new album by The Weeknd?\r\n23.03.2022 16:36:02 - Tiana: Hi Robert, yes I have. It's totally different from his previous works.\r\n23.03.2022 16:37:00 - Robert: I agree. It seems like he's experimenting with a new sound. Did you have a favorite track?\r\n23.03.2022 16:38:25 - Tiana: I think \"Save Your Tears\" was pretty good. What about you?\r\n23.03.2022 16:39:35 - Robert: I quite liked \"Blinding Lights\". It has a catchy tune.\r\n23.03.2022 16:41:10 - Tiana: That's true. It's one of those songs that you can't get out of your head.\r\n23.03.2022 16:42:00 - Robert: Do you think this album will win any awards?\r\n23.03.2022 16:42:34 - Tiana: It's hard to say. The competition is tough this year. But I think he might win a few.\n\nPlease, provide a short summary of each topic discussed in this conversation.

Just finished preparing breakfast for the kids.\r\n05.04.2022 07:35:26 - Kenneth: That's great, Rebecca! And Evelyn, what did you make for the kids?\r\n05.04.2022 07:36:31 - Evelyn: Pancakes and scrambled eggs. They love it.\r\n05.04.2022 07:37:20 - Kenneth: Sounds delicious! I have been working since early morning. Need a coffee break now.\r\n05.04.2022 07:38:08 - Rebecca: Oh, take a break Kenneth.

It's fascinating how much we're able to explore now!\r\n05.04.2022 11:55:32 - Evelyn: I know right! The images it's sending back are simply amazing.\r\n05.04.2022 11:56:34 - Kenneth: It's like we're on the brink of some revolutionary discoveries.\r\n05.04.2022 11:57:13 - Rebecca: I wonder what implications this could have for future space travel.\r\n05.04.2022 11:58:58 - Evelyn: Definitely. But I also hope we don't forget about taking care of our own planet while we're exploring others.\r\n05.04.2022 12:00:40 - Kenneth: That's a good point, Evelyn. It's all a matter of balance.\r\n05.04.2022 12:02:02 - Rebecca: Well said, both of you. I think this is a conversation that needs to be had on a larger scale.\r\n05.04.2022 12:03:35 - Evelyn: Agree. It's a topic that combines science, ethics, environmentalism... so complex.\r\n05.04.2022 12:05:10 - Kenneth: Let's all keep ourselves updated on this. It's interesting to see where it goes.\r\n05.04.2022 15:19:39 - Kenneth: Good morning, Rebecca and Evelyn\r\n05.04.2022 15:20:14 - Rebecca: Morning Kenneth, how's the project going?\r\n05.04.2022 15:22:08 - Kenneth: It's on track, but we're facing some minor issues with the software\r\n05.04.2022 15:22:41 - Evelyn: I've noticed that too, Kenneth. It's been quite slow lately\r\n05.04.2022 15:24:18 - Rebecca: Should we report this to IT?\r\n05.04.2022 15:25:37 - Kenneth: Yes, please do. In the meantime, let's try to make do with what we have\r\n05.04.2022 15:26:35 - Evelyn: Agreed. I'll also make a list of all the issues we've been having\r\n05.04.2022 15:27:13 - Rebecca: Sounds like a plan. Let's also schedule a meeting to discuss this\r\n05.04.2022 15:28:36 - Kenneth: Good idea, Rebecca. Let's meet at 2pm\r\n05.04.2022 15:29:59 - Evelyn: Works for me. Looking forward to resolving these issues\r\n05.04.2022 15:30:58 - Rebecca: Same here. See you both at 2pm\r\n05.04.2022 15:32:48 - Kenneth: See you then. Have a productive morning\r\n05.04.2022 21:12:00 - Kenneth: Hi guys, have you watched the latest episode of 'The Crown' yet?\r\n05.04.2022 21:12:45 - Rebecca: Hey Kenneth, yeah I have. I think the character development this season is really interesting!\r\n05.04.2022 21:13:31 - Evelyn: I haven't seen it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n05.04.2022 21:15:29 - Kenneth: Sure thing, Evelyn. But you should catch up soon. It's getting really good.\r\n05.04.2022 21:16:22 - Rebecca: Definitely! And once you're done, Evelyn, we should all discuss it!\r\n05.04.2022 21:17:35 - Evelyn: Sounds like a plan. I'll try to watch it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:01 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you checked out the new podcast by Malcolm Gladwell?\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:41 - Rebecca: Hi Kenneth, not yet. What's it about?\r\n06.04.2022 02:06:11 - Kenneth: It's called \"Revisionist History\". It's about events in the past that have been misunderstood or overlooked. It's quite interesting.\r\n06.04.2022 02:07:47 - Evelyn: Oh, that sounds like something I would enjoy. I love history.\r\n06.04.2022 02:08:43 - Kenneth: You should definitely check it out then, Evelyn. And you too, Rebecca. I think you'll both like it.\r\n06.04.2022 02:10:39 - Rebecca: I'll certainly give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendation, Kenneth!\r\n06.04.2022 02:11:31 - Evelyn: Adding it to my list now. Thanks, Kenneth!\r\n06.04.2022 02:13:04 - Kenneth: You're welcome! Let me know what you think once you've listened to it.\r\n06.04.2022 02:14:32 - Rebecca: Will do!\r\n06.04.2022 02:16:13 - Evelyn: Same here!\r\n06.04.2022 07:28:43 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you seen the latest episode of 'The Crown' on Netflix?\r\n06.04.2022 07:30:11 - Rebecca: Hi Kenneth, yes I watched it last night. So much drama! Evelyn, have you seen it yet?\r\n06.04.2022 07:31:58 - Evelyn: I haven't gotten around to it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n06.04.2022 07:32:36 - Kenneth: No worries, Evelyn. We'll keep it spoiler-free. But you definitely need to catch up soon!\r\n06.04.2022 07:34:05 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Evelyn. The performances this season are top-notch. They've really outdone themselves.\r\n06.04.2022 07:35:07 - Evelyn: Sounds exciting! I'll make sure to start watching it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 07:36:26 - Kenneth: Great! We can discuss it more once you've seen it. In other news, have you guys heard about the new Star Wars series in development?\r\n06.04.2022 07:38:12 - Rebecca: Yes, I read about it. It's supposed to be set in a completely different timeline, right?\r\n06.04.2022 07:39:56 - Evelyn: That's right. I'm really looking forward to seeing a new side of the Star Wars universe.\r\n06.04.2022 07:41:48 - Kenneth: Me too, it's about time they explored other aspects. I'm quite excited about it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:42:27 - Rebecca: I'm cautiously optimistic. Let's hope they do a good job with it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:43:09 - Evelyn: Agreed. But for now, I'm off to start 'The Crown'. Talk to you guys later!\r\n06.04.2022 11:59:15 - Kenneth: Hello Rebecca and Evelyn, I've been thinking about the concept of free will lately. Do you think our choices are truly ours, or are they predetermined by factors beyond our control?\r\n06.04.2022 12:00:26 - Rebecca: I think it's a mix of both, Kenneth. Some choices are influenced by our surroundings, but we also have the ability to make conscious decisions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:02:11 - Evelyn: Interesting perspective, Rebecca. I often lean more towards determinism though. I believe that every event, including human cognition and behavior, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences.\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:05 - Kenneth: That's a valid point, Evelyn. But doesn't that undermine the notion of moral responsibility? If our actions are predetermined, can we be held accountable for them?\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:44 - Rebecca: I think that's where compatibilism comes in. It's the idea that free will and determinism can coexist. We can make choices, but those choices are influenced by a variety of factors.\r\n06.04.2022 12:06:31 - Evelyn: Yes, Rebecca. Compatibilism is a compelling perspective. It allows for complexity in our understanding of free will and determinism.\r\n06.04.2022 12:07:13 - Kenneth: I agree. It's a complex issue with no clear-cut answers. It's always fascinating to delve into these philosophical discussions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:00 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Kenneth. These discussions always leave me with more questions than answers, but I suppose that's the beauty of philosophy.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:42 - Evelyn: Well said, Rebecca. It's the pursuit of wisdom and understanding that makes philosophy so captivating.\n\nPlease, provide a short summary of each topic discussed in this conversation.

We'll keep it spoiler-free. But you definitely need to catch up soon!\r\n06.04.2022 07:34:05 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Evelyn. The performances this season are top-notch. They've really outdone themselves.\r\n06.04.2022 07:35:07 - Evelyn: Sounds exciting! I'll make sure to start watching it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 07:36:26 - Kenneth: Great! We can discuss it more once you've seen it. In other news, have you guys heard about the new Star Wars series in development?\r\n06.04.2022 07:38:12 - Rebecca: Yes, I read about it. It's supposed to be set in a completely different timeline, right?\r\n06.04.2022 07:39:56 - Evelyn: That's right. I'm really looking forward to seeing a new side of the Star Wars universe.\r\n06.04.2022 07:41:48 - Kenneth: Me too, it's about time they explored other aspects. I'm quite excited about it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:42:27 - Rebecca: I'm cautiously optimistic. Let's hope they do a good job with it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:43:09 - Evelyn: Agreed. But for now, I'm off to start 'The Crown'. Talk to you guys later!\r\n06.04.2022 11:59:15 - Kenneth: Hello Rebecca and Evelyn, I've been thinking about the concept of free will lately. Do you think our choices are truly ours, or are they predetermined by factors beyond our control?\r\n06.04.2022 12:00:26 - Rebecca: I think it's a mix of both, Kenneth. Some choices are influenced by our surroundings, but we also have the ability to make conscious decisions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:02:11 - Evelyn: Interesting perspective, Rebecca. I often lean more towards determinism though. I believe that every event, including human cognition and behavior, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences.\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:05 - Kenneth: That's a valid point, Evelyn. But doesn't that undermine the notion of moral responsibility? If our actions are predetermined, can we be held accountable for them?\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:44 - Rebecca: I think that's where compatibilism comes in. It's the idea that free will and determinism can coexist. We can make choices, but those choices are influenced by a variety of factors.\r\n06.04.2022 12:06:31 - Evelyn: Yes, Rebecca. Compatibilism is a compelling perspective. It allows for complexity in our understanding of free will and determinism.\r\n06.04.2022 12:07:13 - Kenneth: I agree. It's a complex issue with no clear-cut answers. It's always fascinating to delve into these philosophical discussions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:00 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Kenneth. These discussions always leave me with more questions than answers, but I suppose that's the beauty of philosophy.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:42 - Evelyn: Well said, Rebecca. It's the pursuit of wisdom and understanding that makes philosophy so captivating.\n\nPlease, provide a short summary of each topic discussed in this conversation.

Have a productive morning\r\n05.04.2022 21:12:00 - Kenneth: Hi guys, have you watched the latest episode of 'The Crown' yet?\r\n05.04.2022 21:12:45 - Rebecca: Hey Kenneth, yeah I have. I think the character development this season is really interesting!\r\n05.04.2022 21:13:31 - Evelyn: I haven't seen it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n05.04.2022 21:15:29 - Kenneth: Sure thing, Evelyn. But you should catch up soon. It's getting really good.\r\n05.04.2022 21:16:22 - Rebecca: Definitely! And once you're done, Evelyn, we should all discuss it!\r\n05.04.2022 21:17:35 - Evelyn: Sounds like a plan. I'll try to watch it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:01 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you checked out the new podcast by Malcolm Gladwell?\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:41 - Rebecca: Hi Kenneth, not yet. What's it about?\r\n06.04.2022 02:06:11 - Kenneth: It's called \"Revisionist History\". It's about events in the past that have been misunderstood or overlooked. It's quite interesting.\r\n06.04.2022 02:07:47 - Evelyn: Oh, that sounds like something I would enjoy. I love history.\r\n06.04.2022 02:08:43 - Kenneth: You should definitely check it out then, Evelyn. And you too, Rebecca. I think you'll both like it.\r\n06.04.2022 02:10:39 - Rebecca: I'll certainly give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendation, Kenneth!\r\n06.04.2022 02:11:31 - Evelyn: Adding it to my list now. Thanks, Kenneth!\r\n06.04.2022 02:13:04 - Kenneth: You're welcome! Let me know what you think once you've listened to it.\r\n06.04.2022 02:14:32 - Rebecca: Will do!\r\n06.04.2022 02:16:13 - Evelyn: Same here!\r\n06.04.2022 07:28:43 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you seen the latest episode of 'The Crown' on Netflix?\r\n06.04.2022 07:30:11 - Rebecca: Hi Kenneth, yes I watched it last night. So much drama! Evelyn, have you seen it yet?\r\n06.04.2022 07:31:58 - Evelyn: I haven't gotten around to it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n06.04.2022 07:32:36 - Kenneth: No worries, Evelyn. We'll keep it spoiler-free. But you definitely need to catch up soon!\r\n06.04.2022 07:34:05 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Evelyn. The performances this season are top-notch. They've really outdone themselves.\r\n06.04.2022 07:35:07 - Evelyn: Sounds exciting! I'll make sure to start watching it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 07:36:26 - Kenneth: Great! We can discuss it more once you've seen it. In other news, have you guys heard about the new Star Wars series in development?\r\n06.04.2022 07:38:12 - Rebecca: Yes, I read about it. It's supposed to be set in a completely different timeline, right?\r\n06.04.2022 07:39:56 - Evelyn: That's right. I'm really looking forward to seeing a new side of the Star Wars universe.\r\n06.04.2022 07:41:48 - Kenneth: Me too, it's about time they explored other aspects. I'm quite excited about it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:42:27 - Rebecca: I'm cautiously optimistic. Let's hope they do a good job with it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:43:09 - Evelyn: Agreed. But for now, I'm off to start 'The Crown'. Talk to you guys later!\r\n06.04.2022 11:59:15 - Kenneth: Hello Rebecca and Evelyn, I've been thinking about the concept of free will lately. Do you think our choices are truly ours, or are they predetermined by factors beyond our control?\r\n06.04.2022 12:00:26 - Rebecca: I think it's a mix of both, Kenneth. Some choices are influenced by our surroundings, but we also have the ability to make conscious decisions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:02:11 - Evelyn: Interesting perspective, Rebecca. I often lean more towards determinism though. I believe that every event, including human cognition and behavior, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences.\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:05 - Kenneth: That's a valid point, Evelyn. But doesn't that undermine the notion of moral responsibility? If our actions are predetermined, can we be held accountable for them?\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:44 - Rebecca: I think that's where compatibilism comes in. It's the idea that free will and determinism can coexist. We can make choices, but those choices are influenced by a variety of factors.\r\n06.04.2022 12:06:31 - Evelyn: Yes, Rebecca. Compatibilism is a compelling perspective. It allows for complexity in our understanding of free will and determinism.\r\n06.04.2022 12:07:13 - Kenneth: I agree. It's a complex issue with no clear-cut answers. It's always fascinating to delve into these philosophical discussions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:00 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Kenneth. These discussions always leave me with more questions than answers, but I suppose that's the beauty of philosophy.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:42 - Evelyn: Well said, Rebecca. It's the pursuit of wisdom and understanding that makes philosophy so captivating.\n\nPlease, provide a short summary of each topic discussed in this conversation.

I think they're called lucid dreams. They can be quite disconcerting.\r\n02.04.2022 02:40:20 - Sarah: Interesting. I had one last night, and it was about a place I've never been to.

Have a good week until then!\r\n01.04.2022 20:47:50 - Sarah: Hey Geraldine, have you been keeping up with the Olympics?\r\n01.04.2022 20:48:25 - Geraldine: Yes, I have Sarah! I'm really enjoying the swimming events. How about you?\r\n01.04.2022 20:49:15 - Sarah: I've been glued to the athletics! The 100m sprint was incredible!\r\n01.04.2022 20:50:13 - Geraldine: It was, wasn't it? I also loved the gymnastics. Simone Biles is amazing.\r\n01.04.2022 20:51:56 - Sarah: She really is. Have you seen any of the football games?\r\n01.04.2022 20:53:10 - Geraldine: I watched a couple. The skill level is unbelievable!\r\n01.04.2022 20:54:14 - Sarah: It certainly is. I can't wait for the next Olympics.\r\n01.04.2022 20:55:13 - Geraldine: Me neither! It's going to be a long wait but worth it.\r\n02.04.2022 02:37:49 - Sarah: Hey Geraldine, have you ever had a dream that felt so real, you were not sure if you were awake or asleep?\r\n02.04.2022 02:38:49 - Geraldine: Yes, Sarah, I've had such dreams. I think they're called lucid dreams. They can be quite disconcerting.\r\n02.04.2022 02:40:20 - Sarah: Interesting. I had one last night, and it was about a place I've never been to. It was so vivid.\r\n02.04.2022 02:40:53 - Geraldine: That's fascinating, Sarah. Dreams can sometimes be a reflection of our subconscious mind. Any idea what the place signified?\r\n02.04.2022 02:42:17 - Sarah: Not really, Geraldine. But it was peaceful and serene. I felt very calm there.\r\n02.04.2022 02:43:02 - Geraldine: That sounds like a beautiful dream, Sarah. Maybe your mind is telling you that you need some tranquility in your life.\r\n02.04.2022 02:44:12 - Sarah: Maybe you're right, Geraldine. It's been quite hectic lately.\r\n02.04.2022 02:45:49 - Geraldine: Take it as a sign, Sarah. Perhaps it's time for a little break. Dreams can be quite insightful.\r\n02.04.2022 02:46:34 - Sarah: I will, Geraldine. Thanks for the chat. Dreams are indeed fascinating!\r\n02.04.2022 02:47:28 - Geraldine: Absolutely, Sarah.

What about you?\r\n02.04.2022 06:39:06 - Sarah: That sounds fun! I'm thinking of going to the beach.\r\n02.04.2022 06:39:44 - Geraldine: Oh! I wish I could join you. But I've been planning this hike for a while now.\r\n02.04.2022 06:40:53 - Sarah: Maybe next time then. Enjoy your hike!\r\n02.04.2022 06:42:32 - Geraldine: Thanks, Sarah. I hope you have a great time at the beach.\r\n02.04.2022 06:44:11 - Sarah: Thank you Geraldine. Let's catch up next week and share our experiences.\r\n02.04.2022 06:44:51 - Geraldine: That's a great idea, Sarah. Looking forward to it!\r\n02.04.2022 06:45:54 - Sarah: Me too, Geraldine.

Is it worth watching?\r\n22.09.2022 16:57:52 - Steven: I saw it this morning. It's about the impact of AI on video editing. Quite fascinating.\r\n22.09.2022 16:59:00 - Meredith: Exactly, Steven! The way AI can enhance video quality and do complex edits is mind-blowing.\r\n22.09.2022 17:00:17 - Roy: Sounds interesting. I'll definitely give it a watch.\r\n22.09.2022 17:00:55 - Steven: Meredith, do you have any other recommendations?\r\n22.09.2022 17:01:36 - Meredith: Sure, there's another channel 'Science Today' that posted a video about virtual reality. You guys might find it interesting.\r\n22.09.2022 17:03:05 - Roy: Great! Thanks for the recommendations, Meredith.\r\n22.09.2022 17:04:28 - Steven: Yes, thanks Meredith.

Also, we need to prepare the presentation. Who wants to take the lead on that?\r\n22.09.2022 22:28:32 - Steven: I can do that. I'll start working on it after finishing my part.\r\n22.09.2022 22:29:28 - Roy: I can provide the data and figures for the presentation.\r\n22.09.2022 22:31:05 - Meredith: Excellent! Let's reconvene on Friday to review everything.\r\n23.09.2022 04:18:19 - Meredith: Hey guys! Did you catch the latest episode of 'The Crown'?\r\n23.09.2022 04:19:47 - Roy: Hi Meredith! Yes, I did. I think it's one of the best so far. The acting was superb.\r\n23.09.2022 04:20:33 - Steven: I agree with Roy. The detailing was also remarkable. They've really tried to keep things historically accurate.\r\n23.09.2022 04:21:57 - Meredith: Yeah, I was reading about that. It's interesting how they've managed to capture the essence of the era.\r\n23.09.2022 04:22:40 - Steven: True. But have you guys seen 'Breaking Bad'? It's a different genre but the storytelling is brilliant.\r\n23.09.2022 04:23:25 - Roy: I've heard about it but never got around to watching it. Would you recommend it, Steven?\r\n23.09.2022 04:24:32 - Steven: Absolutely! It's a must-watch. The character development is unlike any other show.\r\n23.09.2022 04:26:24 - Meredith: I'll add it to my list then. I've been looking for a new series to start.\r\n23.09.2022 04:28:05 - Roy: Same here. Thanks for the recommendation, Steven!\r\n23.09.2022 04:28:48 - Steven: You're welcome, guys! Let me know what you think once you've seen a few episodes.\r\n23.09.2022 07:01:11 - Meredith: Hi everyone, I was thinking about getting a pet. Any suggestions?\r\n23.09.2022 07:01:49 - Roy: Hey Meredith, that's great! What are you considering? A dog, cat or something else?\r\n23.09.2022 07:02:47 - Steven: A pet can be a great companion, Meredith. Do you have any preferences in terms of size, lifespan, etc.?\r\n23.09.2022 07:04:18 - Meredith: I am thinking of a smaller pet due to my apartment size. Any ideas?\r\n23.09.2022 07:05:12 - Roy: How about a cat? They are relatively low maintenance and perfect for apartments.\r\n23.09.2022 07:06:46 - Steven: A hamster could also be a good option. They are small and easy to take care of.\r\n23.09.2022 07:08:07 - Meredith: Thanks for the suggestions, guys. I'll look into both cats and hamsters.\r\n23.09.2022 07:09:37 - Roy: You're welcome, Meredith.

I think it's one of the best so far. The acting was superb.\r\n23.09.2022 04:20:33 - Steven: I agree with Roy. The detailing was also remarkable. They've really tried to keep things historically accurate.\r\n23.09.2022 04:21:57 - Meredith: Yeah, I was reading about that. It's interesting how they've managed to capture the essence of the era.\r\n23.09.2022 04:22:40 - Steven: True. But have you guys seen 'Breaking Bad'? It's a different genre but the storytelling is brilliant.\r\n23.09.2022 04:23:25 - Roy: I've heard about it but never got around to watching it. Would you recommend it, Steven?\r\n23.09.2022 04:24:32 - Steven: Absolutely! It's a must-watch. The character development is unlike any other show.\r\n23.09.2022 04:26:24 - Meredith: I'll add it to my list then.

Any ideas?\r\n23.09.2022 07:05:12 - Roy: How about a cat? They are relatively low maintenance and perfect for apartments.\r\n23.09.2022 07:06:46 - Steven: A hamster could also be a good option. They are small and easy to take care of.\r\n23.09.2022 07:08:07 - Meredith: Thanks for the suggestions, guys.

Also, we need to prepare the presentation. Who wants to take the lead on that?\r\n22.09.2022 22:28:32 - Steven: I can do that.

I think it's one of the best so far. The acting was superb.\r\n23.09.2022 04:20:33 - Steven: I agree with Roy. The detailing was also remarkable. They've really tried to keep things historically accurate.\r\n23.09.2022 04:21:57 - Meredith: Yeah, I was reading about that. It's interesting how they've managed to capture the essence of the era.\r\n23.09.2022 04:22:40 - Steven: True. But have you guys seen 'Breaking Bad'? It's a different genre but the storytelling is brilliant.\r\n23.09.2022 04:23:25 - Roy: I've heard about it but never got around to watching it. Would you recommend it, Steven?\r\n23.09.2022 04:24:32 - Steven: Absolutely! It's a must-watch. The character development is unlike any other show.\r\n23.09.2022 04:26:24 - Meredith: I'll add it to my list then.

A dog, cat or something else?\r\n23.09.2022 07:02:47 - Steven: A pet can be a great companion, Meredith. Do you have any preferences in terms of size, lifespan, etc.?\r\n23.09.2022 07:04:18 - Meredith: I am thinking of a smaller pet due to my apartment size. Any ideas?\r\n23.09.2022 07:05:12 - Roy: How about a cat? They are relatively low maintenance and perfect for apartments.\r\n23.09.2022 07:06:46 - Steven: A hamster could also be a good option. They are small and easy to take care of.\r\n23.09.2022 07:08:07 - Meredith: Thanks for the suggestions, guys. I'll look into both cats and hamsters.\r\n23.09.2022 07:09:37 - Roy: You're welcome, Meredith.

The wet-on-wet technique was quite tricky but fun to learn.\r\n12.03.2022 18:32:21 - Tre: I'm still struggling with the dry brush technique. Any tips?\r\n12.03.2022 18:33:17 - John: I found watching some tutorial videos really helpful, Tre. Try that.\r\n12.03.2022 18:34:46 - Cindy: Also, always remember to use a stiff brush and very little paint for dry brushing.\r\n12.03.2022 18:35:21 - Jaiden: Great tips, guys! Let's keep practicing and share our artworks next week.\r\n12.03.2022 18:35:55 - John: Sounds like a plan. Looking forward to it.\r\n12.03.2022 18:37:06 - Tre: Me too.

Make sure you're eating a balanced diet, not just restricting certain food groups.\r\n13.03.2022 02:31:45 - Tre: Agreed with Cindy. Also, remember to drink lots of water.\r\n13.03.2022 02:33:08 - John: Absolutely! Exercise is just as important as diet too.\r\n13.03.2022 02:34:54 - Jaiden: Thanks for the tips! I've been trying to incorporate more fruits and veggies.\r\n13.03.2022 02:35:56 - Cindy: That's a good start, Jaiden. Also, try to cut down on processed foods.\r\n13.03.2022 02:36:50 - Tre: Yes, and don't forget about your protein intake. It's essential for muscle health.\r\n13.03.2022 02:38:10 - John: Good point, Tre. Protein is also important for repairing body tissues.\r\n13.03.2022 02:39:10 - Jaiden: I'll keep that in mind! I've also been considering taking supplements.\r\n13.03.2022 02:40:35 - Cindy: It's better to get your nutrients from food, but supplements can help fill the gaps.\r\n13.03.2022 02:41:36 - Tre: Just make sure to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplements.\r\n13.03.2022 02:42:19 - John: Agreed.

It's perfect for my morning runs.\r\n13.03.2022 04:29:28 - John: I'm more of a cool weather guy myself. The heat just drains me.\r\n13.03.2022 04:31:06 - Jaiden: I heard it's supposed to cool down by the weekend.\r\n13.03.2022 04:32:45 - Cindy: That would be a relief. I can't handle another scorcher.\r\n13.03.2022 04:33:54 - Tre: Well, I'm hoping for at least one more hot day. Perfect beach weather.\r\n13.03.2022 04:35:15 - John: Just remember to stay hydrated, everyone. It's easy to forget in this heat.\r\n13.03.2022 09:10:28 - Jaiden: Hey guys, just wondering, what's everyone's major?\r\n13.03.2022 09:12:22 - Cindy: I'm studying Computer Science.

Make sure you're eating a balanced diet, not just restricting certain food groups.\r\n13.03.2022 02:31:45 - Tre: Agreed with Cindy. Also, remember to drink lots of water.\r\n13.03.2022 02:33:08 - John: Absolutely! Exercise is just as important as diet too.\r\n13.03.2022 02:34:54 - Jaiden: Thanks for the tips! I've been trying to incorporate more fruits and veggies.\r\n13.03.2022 02:35:56 - Cindy: That's a good start, Jaiden. Also, try to cut down on processed foods.\r\n13.03.2022 02:36:50 - Tre: Yes, and don't forget about your protein intake. It's essential for muscle health.\r\n13.03.2022 02:38:10 - John: Good point, Tre. Protein is also important for repairing body tissues.\r\n13.03.2022 02:39:10 - Jaiden: I'll keep that in mind!

It's perfect for my morning runs.\r\n13.03.2022 04:29:28 - John: I'm more of a cool weather guy myself. The heat just drains me.\r\n13.03.2022 04:31:06 - Jaiden: I heard it's supposed to cool down by the weekend.\r\n13.03.2022 04:32:45 - Cindy: That would be a relief. I can't handle another scorcher.\r\n13.03.2022 04:33:54 - Tre: Well, I'm hoping for at least one more hot day.

He'll include them in the venue selection process.\r\n23.09.2021 12:52:07 - Sheila: Sure, I can do that. Herman, when do you need them by?\r\n23.09.2021 12:52:42 - Herman: If you can get them to me by the end of the week, that would be perfect.\r\n23.09.2021 12:54:14 - Sheila: Alright, I'll get on it.\r\n23.09.2021 12:55:35 - William: Thanks Sheila and Herman.

I've started painting recently. How about you?\r\n14.10.2021 16:23:32 - Willie: That's cool. I've always admired people who can paint. I've started gardening.\r\n14.10.2021 16:24:21 - Mary: That's interesting. What kind of plants are you growing?\r\n14.10.2021 16:25:55 - Willie: Mainly vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers. It's been really rewarding.\r\n14.10.2021 16:27:09 - Mary: Sounds fun. I've been thinking of starting a small herb garden myself.\r\n14.10.2021 16:27:49 - Willie: I'd highly recommend it.

What about you?\r\n14.10.2021 20:01:36 - Willie: I totally agree, it's different but I like it. Any particular track you like?\r\n14.10.2021 20:02:57 - Mary: Hmm, I really like 'Save Your Tears'. It's catchy.\r\n14.10.2021 20:04:48 - Willie: Yeah, that's a good one! I also like 'Blinding Lights'.\r\n14.10.2021 20:05:44 - Mary: Oh, definitely! That's a classic. It's been on the radio nonstop.\r\n14.10.2021 20:06:19 - Willie: True, it's been quite popular. Do you play any instruments, by the way?\r\n14.10.2021 20:08:12 - Mary: Yes, I play the piano.

It's quite an intriguing concept. It's the idea that individuals are free and responsible for their own choices and actions, right?\r\n14.10.2021 21:54:50 - Willie: Exactly, Mary. It emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and subjectivity.\r\n14.10.2021 21:55:34 - Mary: But don't you think it can lead to a sense of isolation or despair, considering the emphasis on individual freedom and the lack of external forces?\r\n14.10.2021 21:56:22 - Willie: That's a valid point, Mary. However, it also gives the individual the freedom to define their own purpose in life.\r\n14.10.2021 21:57:28 - Mary: True, Willie. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. A balance between individual freedom and understanding the consequences of our choices.\r\n14.10.2021 21:59:05 - Willie: Well said, Mary.

I've started painting recently. How about you?\r\n14.10.2021 16:23:32 - Willie: That's cool. I've always admired people who can paint. I've started gardening.\r\n14.10.2021 16:24:21 - Mary: That's interesting. What kind of plants are you growing?\r\n14.10.2021 16:25:55 - Willie: Mainly vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers. It's been really rewarding.\r\n14.10.2021 16:27:09 - Mary: Sounds fun. I've been thinking of starting a small herb garden myself.\r\n14.10.2021 16:27:49 - Willie: I'd highly recommend it.

What about you?\r\n14.10.2021 20:01:36 - Willie: I totally agree, it's different but I like it. Any particular track you like?\r\n14.10.2021 20:02:57 - Mary: Hmm, I really like 'Save Your Tears'.

I'll let you know when I'm ready.\r\n14.10.2021 21:53:11 - Willie: Hi Mary, have you ever pondered over the concept of existentialism?\r\n14.10.2021 21:54:14 - Mary: Hi Willie, indeed. It's quite an intriguing concept. It's the idea that individuals are free and responsible for their own choices and actions, right?\r\n14.10.2021 21:54:50 - Willie: Exactly, Mary. It emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and subjectivity.\r\n14.10.2021 21:55:34 - Mary: But don't you think it can lead to a sense of isolation or despair, considering the emphasis on individual freedom and the lack of external forces?\r\n14.10.2021 21:56:22 - Willie: That's a valid point, Mary. However, it also gives the individual the freedom to define their own purpose in life.\r\n14.10.2021 21:57:28 - Mary: True, Willie. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. A balance between individual freedom and understanding the consequences of our choices.\r\n14.10.2021 21:59:05 - Willie: Well said, Mary. I think that's the crux of existentialism - understanding that freedom comes with responsibility.\r\n14.10.2021 22:00:48 - Mary: Indeed, Willie. It's a fascinating topic to ponder on.\r\n15.10.2021 02:04:41 - Willie: Hey Mary, just checking in about the Johnson project.\r\n15.10.2021 02:06:08 - Mary: Hi Willie, yes I've been working on it.

I might need some assistance.\r\n15.10.2021 02:11:01 - Willie: Alright, I can get Tom from data science to help out. He's great with these kind of problems.\r\n15.10.2021 02:12:53 - Mary: That would be awesome. I've been stuck for a while.\r\n15.10.2021 02:14:19 - Willie: No problem, I'll set up a meeting for tomorrow.\r\n15.10.2021 02:15:06 - Mary: Thanks Willie, really appreciate it.\r\n15.10.2021 02:16:50 - Willie: Not a problem, Mary.

Do you understand the last question?\r\n15.10.2021 06:38:38 - Mary: Yes, it's a bit tricky but it's about the main ideas of the chapter. Do you want me to explain?\r\n15.10.2021 06:40:24 - Willie: Yes please, I'm a bit confused.\r\n15.10.2021 06:42:24 - Mary: No problem!

I'll add it to my list.\r\n09.04.2022 04:23:05 - Jayden: Do that, Joy. You won't regret it. Also, 'Breaking Bad' is a must-watch if you haven't seen it.\r\n09.04.2022 04:24:52 - Kathleen: Breaking Bad is legendary. Walter White is one of the most complex characters ever.\r\n09.04.2022 04:25:28 - Joy: Alright, 'The Crown' and 'Breaking Bad' added to my list.

It's a psychological thriller and it's really good!\r\n09.04.2022 09:47:55 - Kathleen: I've been reading a lot of non-fiction. I just finished 'Educated' by Tara Westover.\r\n09.04.2022 09:48:56 - Jayden: Oh, I've heard about 'Educated'. It's about a woman who grows up in a strict and abusive household but eventually goes to college, right?\r\n09.04.2022 09:50:08 - Kathleen: Yes, that's the one. It's a very powerful story about the importance of education and the lengths one can go to achieve it.\r\n09.04.2022 09:51:51 - Joy: That sounds interesting. I'll add it to my list. Jayden, any recommendations from you?\r\n09.04.2022 09:53:33 - Jayden: Sure, if you're into fantasy, I'd recommend 'The Name of the Wind'.

I'm leaning towards a smaller college, less stress I guess.\r\n09.04.2022 02:15:00 - Joy: That's a good point, Jayden. But what about the opportunities at larger colleges?\r\n09.04.2022 02:16:27 - Kathleen: I think both have their pros and cons.

I'll add it to my list.\r\n09.04.2022 04:23:05 - Jayden: Do that, Joy. You won't regret it. Also, 'Breaking Bad' is a must-watch if you haven't seen it.\r\n09.04.2022 04:24:52 - Kathleen: Breaking Bad is legendary. Walter White is one of the most complex characters ever.\r\n09.04.2022 04:25:28 - Joy: Alright, 'The Crown' and 'Breaking Bad' added to my list.

I just finished 'Educated' by Tara Westover.\r\n09.04.2022 09:48:56 - Jayden: Oh, I've heard about 'Educated'. It's about a woman who grows up in a strict and abusive household but eventually goes to college, right?\r\n09.04.2022 09:50:08 - Kathleen: Yes, that's the one. It's a very powerful story about the importance of education and the lengths one can go to achieve it.\r\n09.04.2022 09:51:51 - Joy: That sounds interesting. I'll add it to my list. Jayden, any recommendations from you?\r\n09.04.2022 09:53:33 - Jayden: Sure, if you're into fantasy, I'd recommend 'The Name of the Wind'. It's the first book in a trilogy.\r\n09.04.2022 09:54:05 - Joy: I love fantasy! I'll definitely check it out. Kathleen, any other books you'd recommend?\r\n09.04.2022 09:55:38 - Kathleen: If you're interested in history, 'Sapiens' is a great read.

Any more recommendations, guys?\r\n09.04.2022 04:18:15 - Jayden: Have you guys checked 'The Crown'? It's a great historical drama.\r\n09.04.2022 04:19:45 - Kathleen: I love 'The Crown'! The acting and the depiction of the royal family is incredible.\r\n09.04.2022 04:21:23 - Joy: I've heard about it but never got around to watching it. I'll add it to my list.\r\n09.04.2022 04:23:05 - Jayden: Do that, Joy. You won't regret it. Also, 'Breaking Bad' is a must-watch if you haven't seen it.\r\n09.04.2022 04:24:52 - Kathleen: Breaking Bad is legendary. Walter White is one of the most complex characters ever.\r\n09.04.2022 04:25:28 - Joy: Alright, 'The Crown' and 'Breaking Bad' added to my list.

It's a psychological thriller and it's really good!\r\n09.04.2022 09:47:55 - Kathleen: I've been reading a lot of non-fiction. I just finished 'Educated' by Tara Westover.\r\n09.04.2022 09:48:56 - Jayden: Oh, I've heard about 'Educated'. It's about a woman who grows up in a strict and abusive household but eventually goes to college, right?\r\n09.04.2022 09:50:08 - Kathleen: Yes, that's the one. It's a very powerful story about the importance of education and the lengths one can go to achieve it.\r\n09.04.2022 09:51:51 - Joy: That sounds interesting. I'll add it to my list. Jayden, any recommendations from you?\r\n09.04.2022 09:53:33 - Jayden: Sure, if you're into fantasy, I'd recommend 'The Name of the Wind'. It's the first book in a trilogy.\r\n09.04.2022 09:54:05 - Joy: I love fantasy! I'll definitely check it out. Kathleen, any other books you'd recommend?\r\n09.04.2022 09:55:38 - Kathleen: If you're interested in history, 'Sapiens' is a great read. It's about the history of humankind.\r\n09.04.2022 09:56:27 - Jayden: Sounds intriguing. I'll add it to my list. Thanks for the recommendations, guys.\r\n09.04.2022 09:58:04 - Joy: No problem, happy reading!\r\n09.04.2022 09:59:23 - Kathleen: Same to you both.

That was quite a match.\r\n15.05.2022 18:31:34 - Evelyn: I missed it. What happened?\r\n15.05.2022 18:33:02 - Mason: Our team scored 3 goals in the second half.

What does it say?\r\n15.09.2022 15:27:14 - Robert: Well, it seems things are worse than we thought. The report states that human activities are unequivocally causing global warming.\r\n15.09.2022 15:28:12 - Joe: That's concerning. What can we do about it?\r\n15.09.2022 15:28:48 - Robert: The report suggests that significant changes need to be made in how we produce and consume energy. Also, we need to do a better job of managing our natural resources.\r\n15.09.2022 15:30:32 - Joe: I guess we all have a part to play then.\r\n15.09.2022 15:31:06 - Robert: Exactly, it's not just about government policies, but individual actions matter too.\r\n15.09.2022 15:31:46 - Joe: I'll definitely look into it more.

It's a whole new world out here.\r\n15.09.2022 05:56:03 - Robert: Enjoy it, Joe! It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Remember to make the most of it.\r\n15.09.2022 09:30:00 - Robert: Hey Joe, have you seen the latest video on FunnyVids.com?\r\n15.09.2022 09:31:41 - Joe: No, not yet. What's it about?\r\n15.09.2022 09:33:39 - Robert: It's a compilation of the funniest pet fails. It's hilarious!\r\n15.09.2022 09:35:13 - Joe: Oh, I'm gonna have to check that out. I love a good pet fail.\r\n15.09.2022 09:36:42 - Robert: You should. There's one with a cat trying to jump on a shelf, but it totally misses. I almost choked on my coffee.\r\n15.09.2022 09:38:13 - Joe: Haha, sounds like my cat. I'll definitely watch it during my break.\r\n15.09.2022 09:39:16 - Robert: Let me know what you think.

What does it say?\r\n15.09.2022 15:27:14 - Robert: Well, it seems things are worse than we thought. The report states that human activities are unequivocally causing global warming.\r\n15.09.2022 15:28:12 - Joe: That's concerning. What can we do about it?\r\n15.09.2022 15:28:48 - Robert: The report suggests that significant changes need to be made in how we produce and consume energy. Also, we need to do a better job of managing our natural resources.\r\n15.09.2022 15:30:32 - Joe: I guess we all have a part to play then.\r\n15.09.2022 15:31:06 - Robert: Exactly, it's not just about government policies, but individual actions matter too.\r\n15.09.2022 15:31:46 - Joe: I'll definitely look into it more.

It's been too long.\r\n15.09.2022 17:27:49 - Robert: Exactly. Do you remember the last one we had?\r\n15.09.2022 17:28:54 - Joe: Yeah, I remember. It was a lot of fun.

What's it about?\r\n15.09.2022 22:02:50 - Robert: It's a tutorial video about video editing. I thought it might be useful for our project.\r\n15.09.2022 22:03:32 - Joe: Oh, that sounds interesting. I'll check it out soon.\r\n15.09.2022 22:05:23 - Robert: Great!

My cat is very affectionate.\r\n20.03.2022 16:56:38 - Leon: Maybe we should let Adam decide. It's his pet, after all.\r\n20.03.2022 16:57:26 - Adam: You guys have given me a lot to think about.

They've been doing great this season.\r\n20.03.2022 20:50:37 - Jessica: Nice. I've been trying to keep up with both NFL and NBA, but it's a lot.\r\n20.03.2022 20:51:17 - Adam: Agreed, Jessica.

It's really different from his previous stuff, isn't it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:13 - Thomas: Definitely, he seems to be experimenting with a new sound. What did you think of it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:44 - Kristopher: I quite liked it, but I need to listen to it a few more times to fully appreciate it. The lyrics are quite deep.\r\n14.05.2022 11:08:17 - Thomas: I agree. I think 'Save Your Tears' is my favourite track. What's yours?\r\n14.05.2022 11:09:06 - Kristopher: Hmm, I think 'Blinding Lights' is my favourite. I love the synth in it.\r\n14.05.2022 11:10:27 - Thomas: Yeah, that's a great track too. Have you been to any good concerts lately?\r\n14.05.2022 11:11:10 - Kristopher: Not recently, due to the pandemic. But I'm looking forward to seeing some live music again soon.\r\n14.05.2022 11:12:04 - Thomas: Same here.

Is it good?\r\n13.05.2022 23:51:28 - Thomas: It's fantastic! I think it's one of their best yet.\r\n13.05.2022 23:52:32 - Kristopher: Really? Wow, I'll have to check it out then.\r\n13.05.2022 23:53:27 - Thomas: Definitely! Do you like action movies in general?\r\n13.05.2022 23:55:27 - Kristopher: Yes, I do.

Is it any good?\r\n14.05.2022 04:15:31 - Thomas: I think it's amazing! The graphics and gameplay are much better.\r\n14.05.2022 04:16:39 - Kristopher: Sounds good. I've been playing a lot of Fortnite recently.\r\n14.05.2022 04:18:21 - Thomas: I've never really got into Fortnite. I prefer the realism in Call of Duty.\r\n14.05.2022 04:19:25 - Kristopher: Fair enough. Each to their own I guess.\r\n14.05.2022 04:20:18 - Thomas: Exactly. So, are you planning on trying the new Call of Duty?\r\n14.05.2022 04:21:05 - Kristopher: I think I will, especially after hearing your thoughts about it.\r\n14.05.2022 04:22:08 - Thomas: Awesome!

What day are you thinking?\r\n14.05.2022 09:32:13 - Thomas: I was thinking sometime next week. How about Wednesday?\r\n14.05.2022 09:33:14 - Kristopher: Wednesday works for me.

Where will we be meeting?\r\n14.05.2022 09:37:45 - Thomas: I was thinking we could meet at our usual coffee shop. Does that work for you?\r\n14.05.2022 09:38:20 - Kristopher: Yes, the coffee shop works great. I'll see you there.\r\n14.05.2022 09:39:12 - Thomas: Great!

It's really different from his previous stuff, isn't it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:13 - Thomas: Definitely, he seems to be experimenting with a new sound. What did you think of it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:44 - Kristopher: I quite liked it, but I need to listen to it a few more times to fully appreciate it. The lyrics are quite deep.\r\n14.05.2022 11:08:17 - Thomas: I agree. I think 'Save Your Tears' is my favourite track. What's yours?\r\n14.05.2022 11:09:06 - Kristopher: Hmm, I think 'Blinding Lights' is my favourite. I love the synth in it.\r\n14.05.2022 11:10:27 - Thomas: Yeah, that's a great track too. Have you been to any good concerts lately?\r\n14.05.2022 11:11:10 - Kristopher: Not recently, due to the pandemic. But I'm looking forward to seeing some live music again soon.\r\n14.05.2022 11:12:04 - Thomas: Same here.

What time were you thinking?\r\n14.05.2022 09:34:38 - Thomas: How does 2PM sound to you?\r\n14.05.2022 09:36:21 - Kristopher: 2PM sounds perfect. Where will we be meeting?\r\n14.05.2022 09:37:45 - Thomas: I was thinking we could meet at our usual coffee shop. Does that work for you?\r\n14.05.2022 09:38:20 - Kristopher: Yes, the coffee shop works great. I'll see you there.\r\n14.05.2022 09:39:12 - Thomas: Great!

It's really different from his previous stuff, isn't it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:13 - Thomas: Definitely, he seems to be experimenting with a new sound. What did you think of it?\r\n14.05.2022 11:06:44 - Kristopher: I quite liked it, but I need to listen to it a few more times to fully appreciate it. The lyrics are quite deep.\r\n14.05.2022 11:08:17 - Thomas: I agree. I think 'Save Your Tears' is my favourite track. What's yours?\r\n14.05.2022 11:09:06 - Kristopher: Hmm, I think 'Blinding Lights' is my favourite. I love the synth in it.\r\n14.05.2022 11:10:27 - Thomas: Yeah, that's a great track too. Have you been to any good concerts lately?\r\n14.05.2022 11:11:10 - Kristopher: Not recently, due to the pandemic. But I'm looking forward to seeing some live music again soon.\r\n14.05.2022 11:12:04 - Thomas: Same here. Let's plan to go to a concert together once things are back to normal.\r\n14.05.2022 11:12:38 - Kristopher: Sounds like a plan, Thomas.
