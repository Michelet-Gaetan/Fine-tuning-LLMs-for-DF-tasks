We might need an alternative entry point.\r\nScharron: Did you check the ventilation system on the south side? It could be our best bet.\r\nNicholas: Already on it. It\u2019s narrow, but it\u2019s doable. We\u2019ll need to cut power to avoid triggering alarms.\r\nScharron: Agreed. I\u2019ll handle the power grid. You just make sure the cameras are looped before we move in.\r\nNicholas: Looping the cameras now. We\u2019ll have a 15-minute window. Is the getaway vehicle ready?\r\nScharron: Yes, it\u2019s parked two blocks away. Remember, we\u2019ve got to be quick. The guards change shifts at 02:00.\r\nNicholas: Perfect timing then. I\u2019ll signal you once I\u2019m inside. Stay sharp.\r\nScharron: Understood. Let\u2019s make this clean. We can\u2019t afford any mistakes tonight.\r\nNicholas: Copy that. I\u2019m heading in now. Keep the comms open in case things go sideways.\r\nScharron: I\u2019m monitoring everything from here.
