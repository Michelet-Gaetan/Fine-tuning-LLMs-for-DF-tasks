Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try.

Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked.

I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

When and where?\r\n03.04.2022 20:07:20 - Trinity: Let's meet at the usual spot. Tomorrow at 9.\r\n03.04.2022 20:08:58 - Glenda: Alright.

Maybe it's time for a change.\r\n03.04.2022 20:16:18 - Glenda: Exactly. See you tomorrow, Trinity.\r\n03.04.2022 20:18:14 - Trinity: See you, Glenda.\r\n04.04.2022 00:59:16 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you seen the latest video on the SuperVlog channel?\r\n04.04.2022 01:00:48 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, no I haven't. I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n04.04.2022 01:06:51 - Glenda: Definitely, I'll get back to you after watching.\r\n04.04.2022 02:53:24 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you ever been to Japan?\r\n04.04.2022 02:54:23 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, yes, I have. It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great! Looking forward to it. Let's conquer the virtual world together!\r\n04.04.2022 07:40:22 - Glenda: Indeed! It's going to be a blast!\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:07 - Trinity: Hi Glenda, how have you been feeling lately?\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:50 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, not so great. I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

It\u2019s a plan then!\r\n01.09.2021 16:23:34 - John: Hi everyone, have you read any good books lately?\r\n01.09.2021 16:25:08 - Peter: I've just finished 'The Silent Patient'. A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed!

Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n04.04.2022 01:06:51 - Glenda: Definitely, I'll get back to you after watching.\r\n04.04.2022 02:53:24 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you ever been to Japan?\r\n04.04.2022 02:54:23 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, yes, I have. It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great! Looking forward to it. Let's conquer the virtual world together!\r\n04.04.2022 07:40:22 - Glenda: Indeed! It's going to be a blast!\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:07 - Trinity: Hi Glenda, how have you been feeling lately?\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:50 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, not so great. I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

I loved the battle scenes!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:07 - Richard: I agree, Peter. The special effects were top notch!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:55 - Karen: I haven't seen it yet! No spoilers, please!\r\n01.09.2021 13:22:22 - Ashley: I'm with Karen on this one, still need to catch up!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:15 - John: Okay, no spoilers.

Can't wait for it!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:00 - Karen: Gosh, I need to hurry up then. So much to watch, so little time!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:33 - Ashley: Tell me about it, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover.

What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality.

Looking forward to it.\r\n01.09.2021 13:19:00 - John: Hey guys, have you seen the latest episode of The Witcher yet?\r\n01.09.2021 13:19:31 - Peter: Oh yes, it was amazing! I loved the battle scenes!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:07 - Richard: I agree, Peter. The special effects were top notch!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:55 - Karen: I haven't seen it yet! No spoilers, please!\r\n01.09.2021 13:22:22 - Ashley: I'm with Karen on this one, still need to catch up!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:15 - John: Okay, no spoilers. But you guys should definitely watch it soon!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:54 - Peter: I heard the next season is coming out next year. Is that right?\r\n01.09.2021 13:25:53 - Richard: Yes, that's correct! Can't wait for it!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:00 - Karen: Gosh, I need to hurry up then. So much to watch, so little time!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:33 - Ashley: Tell me about it, Karen. The list just keeps getting longer!\r\n01.09.2021 13:28:50 - John: Maybe we should have a movie night and watch it together?\r\n01.09.2021 13:29:36 - Peter: That's a great idea, John!\r\n01.09.2021 13:30:32 - Richard: I'm in!\r\n01.09.2021 13:31:19 - Karen: Me too!\r\n01.09.2021 13:33:09 - Ashley: Count me in! It\u2019s a plan then!\r\n01.09.2021 16:23:34 - John: Hi everyone, have you read any good books lately?\r\n01.09.2021 16:25:08 - Peter: I've just finished 'The Silent Patient'. A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing!

It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd.

The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

It\u2019s a plan then!\r\n01.09.2021 16:23:34 - John: Hi everyone, have you read any good books lately?\r\n01.09.2021 16:25:08 - Peter: I've just finished 'The Silent Patient'. A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool!

It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

See you tomorrow, Trinity.\r\n03.04.2022 20:18:14 - Trinity: See you, Glenda.\r\n04.04.2022 00:59:16 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you seen the latest video on the SuperVlog channel?\r\n04.04.2022 01:00:48 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, no I haven't. I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n04.04.2022 01:06:51 - Glenda: Definitely, I'll get back to you after watching.\r\n04.04.2022 02:53:24 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you ever been to Japan?\r\n04.04.2022 02:54:23 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, yes, I have. It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great! Looking forward to it. Let's conquer the virtual world together!\r\n04.04.2022 07:40:22 - Glenda: Indeed! It's going to be a blast!\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:07 - Trinity: Hi Glenda, how have you been feeling lately?\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:50 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, not so great. I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

I loved the battle scenes!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:07 - Richard: I agree, Peter. The special effects were top notch!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:55 - Karen: I haven't seen it yet!

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter.

I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet.

Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen. Let's do it.\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

It's going to be a blast!\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:07 - Trinity: Hi Glenda, how have you been feeling lately?\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:50 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, not so great. I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool!

It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed!

I loved the battle scenes!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:07 - Richard: I agree, Peter. The special effects were top notch!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:55 - Karen: I haven't seen it yet!

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

But you guys should definitely watch it soon!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:54 - Peter: I heard the next season is coming out next year. Is that right?\r\n01.09.2021 13:25:53 - Richard: Yes, that's correct! Can't wait for it!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:00 - Karen: Gosh, I need to hurry up then. So much to watch, so little time!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:33 - Ashley: Tell me about it, Karen. The list just keeps getting longer!\r\n01.09.2021 13:28:50 - John: Maybe we should have a movie night and watch it together?\r\n01.09.2021 13:29:36 - Peter: That's a great idea, John!\r\n01.09.2021 13:30:32 - Richard: I'm in!\r\n01.09.2021 13:31:19 - Karen: Me too!\r\n01.09.2021 13:33:09 - Ashley: Count me in! It\u2019s a plan then!\r\n01.09.2021 16:23:34 - John: Hi everyone, have you read any good books lately?\r\n01.09.2021 16:25:08 - Peter: I've just finished 'The Silent Patient'. A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food?

Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd.

Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail.

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed.

Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n04.04.2022 01:06:51 - Glenda: Definitely, I'll get back to you after watching.\r\n04.04.2022 02:53:24 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you ever been to Japan?\r\n04.04.2022 02:54:23 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, yes, I have. It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet.

Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great.

I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great! Looking forward to it. Let's conquer the virtual world together!\r\n04.04.2022 07:40:22 - Glenda: Indeed! It's going to be a blast!\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:07 - Trinity: Hi Glenda, how have you been feeling lately?\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:50 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, not so great. I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely.

The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

Too risky.\r\n03.04.2022 20:12:07 - Trinity: What about the team?\r\n03.04.2022 20:14:02 - Glenda: They'll manage. This isn't a game anymore, Trinity.\r\n03.04.2022 20:15:02 - Trinity: You're right. Maybe it's time for a change.\r\n03.04.2022 20:16:18 - Glenda: Exactly. See you tomorrow, Trinity.\r\n03.04.2022 20:18:14 - Trinity: See you, Glenda.\r\n04.04.2022 00:59:16 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you seen the latest video on the SuperVlog channel?\r\n04.04.2022 01:00:48 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, no I haven't. I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n04.04.2022 01:06:51 - Glenda: Definitely, I'll get back to you after watching.\r\n04.04.2022 02:53:24 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you ever been to Japan?\r\n04.04.2022 02:54:23 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, yes, I have.

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

When and where?\r\n03.04.2022 20:07:20 - Trinity: Let's meet at the usual spot. Tomorrow at 9.\r\n03.04.2022 20:08:58 - Glenda: Alright. But this is the last time, Trinity.\r\n03.04.2022 20:10:23 - Trinity: What? Why's that?\r\n03.04.2022 20:11:09 - Glenda: I'm getting out of the business. Too risky.\r\n03.04.2022 20:12:07 - Trinity: What about the team?\r\n03.04.2022 20:14:02 - Glenda: They'll manage. This isn't a game anymore, Trinity.\r\n03.04.2022 20:15:02 - Trinity: You're right. Maybe it's time for a change.\r\n03.04.2022 20:16:18 - Glenda: Exactly. See you tomorrow, Trinity.\r\n03.04.2022 20:18:14 - Trinity: See you, Glenda.\r\n04.04.2022 00:59:16 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you seen the latest video on the SuperVlog channel?\r\n04.04.2022 01:00:48 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, no I haven't. I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n04.04.2022 01:06:51 - Glenda: Definitely, I'll get back to you after watching.\r\n04.04.2022 02:53:24 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you ever been to Japan?\r\n04.04.2022 02:54:23 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, yes, I have. It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great! Looking forward to it. Let's conquer the virtual world together!\r\n04.04.2022 07:40:22 - Glenda: Indeed! It's going to be a blast!\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:07 - Trinity: Hi Glenda, how have you been feeling lately?\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:50 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, not so great. I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter.

I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen. Let's do it.\n\nPlease, identify the relevant topic(s) given the criminal charges investigated, and provide a summary of it!

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n04.04.2022 01:06:51 - Glenda: Definitely, I'll get back to you after watching.\r\n04.04.2022 02:53:24 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you ever been to Japan?\r\n04.04.2022 02:54:23 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, yes, I have. It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits.

What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits.

It's definitely worth watching.\r\n01.09.2021 09:33:00 - Peter: Great, I'll watch it too then.\r\n01.09.2021 09:34:05 - Richard: You won't regret it, Peter.\r\n01.09.2021 09:35:35 - Karen: Let's all discuss it after we've watched it.\r\n01.09.2021 09:36:47 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen. Looking forward to it.\r\n01.09.2021 13:19:00 - John: Hey guys, have you seen the latest episode of The Witcher yet?\r\n01.09.2021 13:19:31 - Peter: Oh yes, it was amazing! I loved the battle scenes!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:07 - Richard: I agree, Peter. The special effects were top notch!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:55 - Karen: I haven't seen it yet! No spoilers, please!\r\n01.09.2021 13:22:22 - Ashley: I'm with Karen on this one, still need to catch up!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:15 - John: Okay, no spoilers. But you guys should definitely watch it soon!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:54 - Peter: I heard the next season is coming out next year. Is that right?\r\n01.09.2021 13:25:53 - Richard: Yes, that's correct! Can't wait for it!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:00 - Karen: Gosh, I need to hurry up then. So much to watch, so little time!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:33 - Ashley: Tell me about it, Karen. The list just keeps getting longer!\r\n01.09.2021 13:28:50 - John: Maybe we should have a movie night and watch it together?\r\n01.09.2021 13:29:36 - Peter: That's a great idea, John!\r\n01.09.2021 13:30:32 - Richard: I'm in!\r\n01.09.2021 13:31:19 - Karen: Me too!\r\n01.09.2021 13:33:09 - Ashley: Count me in! It\u2019s a plan then!\r\n01.09.2021 16:23:34 - John: Hi everyone, have you read any good books lately?\r\n01.09.2021 16:25:08 - Peter: I've just finished 'The Silent Patient'. A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

The list just keeps getting longer!\r\n01.09.2021 13:28:50 - John: Maybe we should have a movie night and watch it together?\r\n01.09.2021 13:29:36 - Peter: That's a great idea, John!\r\n01.09.2021 13:30:32 - Richard: I'm in!\r\n01.09.2021 13:31:19 - Karen: Me too!\r\n01.09.2021 13:33:09 - Ashley: Count me in! It\u2019s a plan then!\r\n01.09.2021 16:23:34 - John: Hi everyone, have you read any good books lately?\r\n01.09.2021 16:25:08 - Peter: I've just finished 'The Silent Patient'. A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'.
