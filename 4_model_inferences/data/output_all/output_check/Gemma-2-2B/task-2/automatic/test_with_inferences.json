I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great.

We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd.

The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed!

But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter.

I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed.

I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing!

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd.

The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great.

We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n04.04.2022 01:06:51 - Glenda: Definitely, I'll get back to you after watching.\r\n04.04.2022 02:53:24 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you ever been to Japan?\r\n04.04.2022 02:54:23 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, yes, I have. It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great! Looking forward to it. Let's conquer the virtual world together!\r\n04.04.2022 07:40:22 - Glenda: Indeed! It's going to be a blast!\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:07 - Trinity: Hi Glenda, how have you been feeling lately?\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:50 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, not so great. I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama.

Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Can't wait for it!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:00 - Karen: Gosh, I need to hurry up then. So much to watch, so little time!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:33 - Ashley: Tell me about it, Karen. The list just keeps getting longer!\r\n01.09.2021 13:28:50 - John: Maybe we should have a movie night and watch it together?\r\n01.09.2021 13:29:36 - Peter: That's a great idea, John!\r\n01.09.2021 13:30:32 - Richard: I'm in!\r\n01.09.2021 13:31:19 - Karen: Me too!\r\n01.09.2021 13:33:09 - Ashley: Count me in! It\u2019s a plan then!\r\n01.09.2021 16:23:34 - John: Hi everyone, have you read any good books lately?\r\n01.09.2021 16:25:08 - Peter: I've just finished 'The Silent Patient'. A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree.

The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter.

The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Karen appreciates Peter's idea, emphasizing the need for discretion. Ashley then commits to contacting her sources, with John asking her to keep them all updated. Richard ends the conversation by reminding everyone to tread carefully.",

Too risky.\r\n03.04.2022 20:12:07 - Trinity: What about the team?\r\n03.04.2022 20:14:02 - Glenda: They'll manage. This isn't a game anymore, Trinity.\r\n03.04.2022 20:15:02 - Trinity: You're right.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool!

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed.

Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great.

Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting. They're discussing the impact of viral videos on social media platforms.\r\n04.04.2022 01:03:40 - Glenda: Sounds intriguing! I'll check it out when I get some free time.\r\n04.04.2022 01:05:35 - Trinity: Cool!

It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd.

The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

It's going to be a blast!\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:07 - Trinity: Hi Glenda, how have you been feeling lately?\r\n04.04.2022 11:41:50 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, not so great. I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter.

I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Looking forward to it.\r\n01.09.2021 13:19:00 - John: Hey guys, have you seen the latest episode of The Witcher yet?\r\n01.09.2021 13:19:31 - Peter: Oh yes, it was amazing! I loved the battle scenes!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:07 - Richard: I agree, Peter. The special effects were top notch!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:55 - Karen: I haven't seen it yet! No spoilers, please!\r\n01.09.2021 13:22:22 - Ashley: I'm with Karen on this one, still need to catch up!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:15 - John: Okay, no spoilers. But you guys should definitely watch it soon!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:54 - Peter: I heard the next season is coming out next year. Is that right?\r\n01.09.2021 13:25:53 - Richard: Yes, that's correct! Can't wait for it!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:00 - Karen: Gosh, I need to hurry up then. So much to watch, so little time!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:33 - Ashley: Tell me about it, Karen.

It\u2019s a plan then!\r\n01.09.2021 16:23:34 - John: Hi everyone, have you read any good books lately?\r\n01.09.2021 16:25:08 - Peter: I've just finished 'The Silent Patient'. A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed.

I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

I've been quite busy. Is it good?\r\n04.04.2022 01:01:43 - Trinity: Yes, it's really interesting.

Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd.

The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

Let me know what you think once you've watched it.\r\n04.04.2022 01:06:51 - Glenda: Definitely, I'll get back to you after watching.\r\n04.04.2022 02:53:24 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you ever been to Japan?\r\n04.04.2022 02:54:23 - Glenda: Hi Trinity, yes, I have. It was an amazing experience.\r\n04.04.2022 02:55:51 - Trinity: That's cool! I'm planning a trip there. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n04.04.2022 02:56:44 - Glenda: Definitely. Tokyo is a must visit. The city's mix of modern and traditional is fascinating.\r\n04.04.2022 02:57:19 - Trinity: Tokyo is definitely on my list. How about food? Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great! I'll add them to my itinerary. Any tips on local customs?\r\n04.04.2022 03:05:04 - Glenda: Just be respectful and follow the crowd. Japanese people are very polite and well-mannered.\r\n04.04.2022 03:06:27 - Trinity: Got it, thanks for the tips Glenda!\r\n04.04.2022 03:08:25 - Glenda: You're welcome Trinity, have a wonderful trip!\r\n04.04.2022 07:28:21 - Trinity: Hey Glenda, have you played the new release from Rockstar Games?\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:16 - Glenda: Yes Trinity, I've started playing it. The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail. How far are you in the game?\r\n04.04.2022 07:31:26 - Glenda: Well, I just completed the third mission. The storyline is really engaging.\r\n04.04.2022 07:32:55 - Trinity: Agreed! I love how they've incorporated different elements. Have you tried the multiplayer mode yet?\r\n04.04.2022 07:33:52 - Glenda: No, not yet. But I've heard it's a lot of fun.\r\n04.04.2022 07:35:31 - Trinity: It is! You should definitely give it a try. Maybe we can play together sometime?\r\n04.04.2022 07:36:23 - Glenda: Sure, that sounds like fun! I'll let you know once I'm ready for multiplayer.\r\n04.04.2022 07:38:22 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter.

I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet.

Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter.

Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

No spoilers, please!\r\n01.09.2021 13:22:22 - Ashley: I'm with Karen on this one, still need to catch up!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:15 - John: Okay, no spoilers. But you guys should definitely watch it soon!\r\n01.09.2021 13:24:54 - Peter: I heard the next season is coming out next year. Is that right?\r\n01.09.2021 13:25:53 - Richard: Yes, that's correct! Can't wait for it!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:00 - Karen: Gosh, I need to hurry up then. So much to watch, so little time!\r\n01.09.2021 13:27:33 - Ashley: Tell me about it, Karen. The list just keeps getting longer!\r\n01.09.2021 13:28:50 - John: Maybe we should have a movie night and watch it together?\r\n01.09.2021 13:29:36 - Peter: That's a great idea, John!\r\n01.09.2021 13:30:32 - Richard: I'm in!\r\n01.09.2021 13:31:19 - Karen: Me too!\r\n01.09.2021 13:33:09 - Ashley: Count me in! It\u2019s a plan then!\r\n01.09.2021 16:23:34 - John: Hi everyone, have you read any good books lately?\r\n01.09.2021 16:25:08 - Peter: I've just finished 'The Silent Patient'. A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

Any specific dish I should try?\r\n04.04.2022 02:59:15 - Glenda: You should definitely try sushi from a sushi bar, and Ramen from a Ramen shop.\r\n04.04.2022 03:00:47 - Trinity: Sounds delicious! Did you visit any other cities?\r\n04.04.2022 03:01:35 - Glenda: Yes, I also visited Kyoto and Hiroshima. Both were stunning in their own ways.\r\n04.04.2022 03:03:04 - Trinity: Great!

I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.\r\n04.04.2022 11:42:52 - Trinity: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree.

I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:09 - Glenda: Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.\r\n04.04.2022 11:47:41 - Trinity: That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?\r\n04.04.2022 11:49:32 - Glenda: Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.\r\n04.04.2022 13:15:29 - Trinity: Good morning, Glenda. Hope you're doing well.\r\n04.04.2022 13:16:31 - Glenda: Good morning, Trinity! I'm doing well, thank you. How about you?\r\n04.04.2022 13:17:38 - Trinity: I'm good, thanks for asking. I wanted to discuss the new project we've been assigned.\r\n04.04.2022 13:19:14 - Glenda: Sure, Trinity. What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect. I'll send out the calendar invite.\r\n04.04.2022 13:23:40 - Glenda: Great! In the meantime, I'll go through the project brief again. If I have any questions or suggestions, I'll email you.\r\n04.04.2022 13:24:58 - Trinity: That sounds like a plan.

What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits.

We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs.

What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

The graphics are amazing!\r\n04.04.2022 07:29:48 - Trinity: I know right! I love the level of detail.

Have you seen a doctor?\r\n04.04.2022 11:43:42 - Glenda: No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.\r\n04.04.2022 11:44:48 - Trinity: It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:29 - Glenda: You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.\r\n04.04.2022 11:45:59 - Trinity: Great.

What's up?\r\n04.04.2022 13:20:54 - Trinity: I was going through the project brief and I think we need to schedule a meeting with the team to discuss the execution plan.\r\n04.04.2022 13:21:39 - Glenda: I agree. We need to have a clear understanding and plan before we start. How about tomorrow at 10 AM?\r\n04.04.2022 13:22:33 - Trinity: Sounds perfect.

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover.

It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley.

This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed.

What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John.

We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

I loved the battle scenes!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:07 - Richard: I agree, Peter. The special effects were top notch!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:55 - Karen: I haven't seen it yet!

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet.

Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.
