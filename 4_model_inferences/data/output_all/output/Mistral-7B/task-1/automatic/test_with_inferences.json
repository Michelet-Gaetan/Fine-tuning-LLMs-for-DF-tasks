What's on your mind?\r\nClara: I've been thinking about the museum heist. We need to plan carefully.\r\nCarlton: Agreed. Let's start with the security. Any idea what we're dealing with?\r\nClara: They have motion detectors and laser security grids. But, I have a contact who can help us disable it.\r\nCarlton: Sounds promising. What about the guards and surveillance cameras?\r\nClara: There are four guards on rotation and cameras at every corner. We might need a distraction.\r\nCarlton: I might know just the guy for that. Can we trust your contact though?\r\nClara: Absolutely. She's a pro.

But we need someone on the lookout too.\r\nJason: Good point, Mario. Desiree, could you handle that?\r\nDesiree: Sure, Jason. I'll keep an eye out for any unexpected surprises.\r\nKatherine: Let's meet tomorrow to discuss the plan in detail.\r\nRonda: Works for me. Let's keep everything low-key as usual.\r\nMario: Agreed.

Lavern, you\u2019re on lookout, right?\r\nLavern: Yeah, I\u2019ll have the van ready around the corner. Make sure you wear gloves.\r\nLinda: Got it. We can\u2019t leave any traces behind. How about the security cameras?\r\nAshton: Ryan\u2019s got that covered. He\u2019ll loop the feed while we\u2019re inside.\r\nRyan: I\u2019ll disable them as soon as we\u2019re ready to move in. No one will even know we were there.\r\nLinda: Alright, then we\u2019re all set. Let\u2019s get this done quickly and cleanly.\r\nLavern: Agreed. No mistakes this time.

I\u2019ll signal you once I\u2019m inside. Stay sharp.\r\nScharron: Understood. Let\u2019s make this clean. We can\u2019t afford any mistakes tonight.\r\nNicholas: Copy that. I\u2019m heading in now.
