John;Planning a heist, are we?
Robert;Exactly John, our target is the Louvre.
John;Alright, what's the first step?
Robert;Infiltration. We need to understand the layout, security, and any potential weaknesses.
John;Sounds like a job for Michael. He's good with schematics.
Robert;Agreed. Michael, can you handle that?
Michael;On it, boss. I'll get the blueprints and start studying them ASAP.
John;Next, we need a diversion. Something to draw the guards away.
Robert;That's where Mary comes in. She's an expert in diversion tactics.
Mary;Consider it done. I'll need some time to craft a believable scenario.
John;Time is one thing we have. Let's plan this right.
Robert;Exactly. Let's meet again tomorrow with updates. Michael, Mary, you know what to do.
Michael;Understood, boss. I'll get to work right away.
Mary;Same here. I won't let you down.
