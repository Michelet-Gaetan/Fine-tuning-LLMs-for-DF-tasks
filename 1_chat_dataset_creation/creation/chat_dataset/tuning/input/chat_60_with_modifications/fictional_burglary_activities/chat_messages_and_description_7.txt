John;So, we're really going through with this, huh?
Robert;Looks like it. Got the blueprints ready?
James;Right here. The safe is in the basement.
William;That's a tight spot. We need a good plan.
Robert;Let's not rush things. We have time.
John;Agreed. Everyone needs to know their part.
James;I'll get the tools. We need to be silent and quick.
William;I can distract the guards. Used to be one, remember?
Robert;Perfect. John, you're with James. I'll be the lookout.
John;Sounds like a plan. Let's meet tomorrow to finalize everything.
