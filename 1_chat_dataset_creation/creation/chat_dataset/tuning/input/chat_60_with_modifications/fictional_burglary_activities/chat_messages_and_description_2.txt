James;Hey, you got the details for our next mission?
Robert;Yeah, got them from the boss. It's a mansion in the outskirts.
James;A mansion, huh? Fancy. Any idea about the security?
Robert;The usual stuff. CCTV, alarms, guards. We'll need to be careful.
James;And the valuables?
Robert;Lots. Artwork, jewels, cash. It's a goldmine.
James;We'll need a solid plan then. Let's meet up and discuss.
Robert;Agreed. Tomorrow, our usual spot?
James;Sounds good. See you then, mate.
