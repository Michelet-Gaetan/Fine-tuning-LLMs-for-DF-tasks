James;Just got word of a possible target. High value, high risk.
Michael;I'm in. What are we looking at?
James;A private collection. Art, jewels, all secured in a private estate.
Robert;Sounds like we're going to need a plan. Michael, any ideas?
Michael;I think we need inside information. Someone on the inside to give us a layout.
John;I can get us that. I know a guy.
James;Okay, we meet tomorrow to discuss the plan. Be prepared.
Robert;We also need a contingency plan, in case things go south.
John;Agreed. We need to cover all our bases.
Michael;Let's do this. Tomorrow, we start planning.
