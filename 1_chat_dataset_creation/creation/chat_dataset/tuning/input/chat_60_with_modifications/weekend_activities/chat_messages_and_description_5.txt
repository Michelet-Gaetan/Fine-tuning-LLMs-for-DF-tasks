James;Hey John, what's your plan for this weekend?
John;Hey James, I'm thinking of going hiking. What about you?
James;That sounds great. I was thinking of going to a cooking class this weekend.
John;Oh cool! What type of cuisine?
James;Italian. I've always wanted to learn how to make homemade pasta.
John;That sounds delicious. Let's share our experiences on Monday.
James;Definitely, looking forward to it.
John;Same here. Have a great weekend James!
