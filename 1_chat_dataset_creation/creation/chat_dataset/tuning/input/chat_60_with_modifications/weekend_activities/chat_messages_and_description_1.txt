Robert;Hey John, what are you doing this weekend?
John;Hey Robert, I'm not sure yet. What about you?
Robert;I was thinking of going for a hike. Would you like to join?
John;That sounds like a great idea. Where are you planning to hike?
Robert;I was considering the trails at Blue Ridge Mountains. It's beautiful this time of year.
John;I've heard so much about it but never been there. I'm in!
Robert;Awesome, let's plan for Saturday. We can leave early morning.
John;Sounds like a plan. I'll bring some sandwiches for us.
Robert;Great. I'll handle the drinks then. See you Saturday.
John;See you Saturday, Robert. Looking forward to it.
