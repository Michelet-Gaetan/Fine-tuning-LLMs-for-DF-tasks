John;Hey Michael, any plans for the weekend?
Michael;Hi John, I was thinking about going hiking. Want to join?
John;Sounds awesome! Which trail are you thinking about?
Michael;I was considering the Blue Ridge trail. It's quite scenic this time of the year.
John;I've heard good things about it. Let's do it!
Michael;Great! We can meet at my place at 7am on Saturday.
John;Perfect. I'll bring some snacks and water.
Michael;Great, I'll take care of the map and first aid kit. See you then!
John;See you on Saturday, Michael. Looking forward to it!
