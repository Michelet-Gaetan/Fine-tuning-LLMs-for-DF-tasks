John;Hey Robert! Yes, I am thinking about going for a hike. How about you?
Robert;That sounds great! I was planning to try out a new recipe and do some reading. Which trail are you planning to hike?
John;I'm considering the Blue Ridge Mountain trail.
Robert;That's a beautiful trail. I have been there a couple of times. Make sure to carry enough water.
