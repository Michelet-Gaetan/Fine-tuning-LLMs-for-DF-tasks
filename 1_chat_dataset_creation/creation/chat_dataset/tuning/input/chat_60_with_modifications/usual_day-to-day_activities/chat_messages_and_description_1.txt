James;Morning, John. How's it going?
John;Hi James. Just about to leave for work. Running a bit late today.
James;Ah, don't worry about it. We've all been there.
John;Yeah, I suppose. How about you? What's your day looking like?
James;Just finished making breakfast. Planning on going for a run later.
John;Sounds good. I should really start exercising more.
James;It's never too late to start, John. I could give you some tips if you like.
John;That would be great, James. Let's talk about it later. Got to dash now.
James;No problem, John. Have a good day at work!
John;Thanks, James. Have a good run.
