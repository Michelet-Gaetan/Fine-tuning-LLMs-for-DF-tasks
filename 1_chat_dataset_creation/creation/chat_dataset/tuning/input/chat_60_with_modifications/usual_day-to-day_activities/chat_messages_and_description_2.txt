David;Hey John, how was your day?
John;Hey David, it was quite hectic. How about yours?
David;Oh, mine was fairly relaxed. Had a few meetings though.
John;That sounds nice. I was stuck with a pile of paperwork.
David;Oh, that doesn't sound fun. Anything interesting?
John;Not really, just usual office stuff.
David;Alright. What are your plans for dinner?
John;Thinking of cooking something. Maybe pasta.
David;That sounds nice. I think I'll order pizza.
John;Not a bad idea. Maybe I'll do the same.
