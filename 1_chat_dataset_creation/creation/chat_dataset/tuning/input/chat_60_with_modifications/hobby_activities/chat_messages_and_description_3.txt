John;Hey Robert, have you tried any new hobbies lately?
Robert;Hey John! Yes, I just started learning to play the guitar. How about you?
John;That's awesome! I've been getting into bird watching. There are so many species around my area.
Robert;Wow, that sounds interesting. I've never considered bird watching. What got you into it?
John;Well, I was looking for a hobby that would allow me to spend more time outdoors. Plus, it's pretty relaxing.
Robert;That's a great point. Maybe I should try it out sometime. How do you identify the different species?
John;There are some great apps that help identify birds by their looks and sounds. Plus, I have a guide book that's been really helpful.
Robert;That's quite cool. I'll definitely consider it. Thanks for the suggestion, John.
John;No problem, Robert. Let's share more about our hobbies next time.
