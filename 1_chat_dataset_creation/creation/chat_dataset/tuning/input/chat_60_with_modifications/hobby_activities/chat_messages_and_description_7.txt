Robert;Hey guys, what are your plans for this weekend?
Jennifer;Hi Robert, I was thinking of going bird-watching. There's a park nearby that is perfect for it.
Paul;That sounds interesting, Jennifer. I might join you. As for me, I'll probably spend some time painting. It's been a while.
Robert;Awesome, I was planning to do some gardening. Maybe we can share pictures of our activities afterward.
Jennifer;That's a great idea, Robert. I'll definitely take some pictures of the birds I spot.
Paul;Count me in. I'd love to see your garden, Robert, and the birds you spot, Jennifer.
