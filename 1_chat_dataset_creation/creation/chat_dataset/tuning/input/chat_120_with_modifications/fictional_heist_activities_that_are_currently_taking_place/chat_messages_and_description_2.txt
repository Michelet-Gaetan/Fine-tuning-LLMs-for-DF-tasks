Matthew;Hey James, are you set for the job tonight?
James;Yes Matthew, I've got all the equipment ready. Just need to run a final check.
Matthew;Good. Remember, we cannot afford to make any mistakes.
James;I understand, Matthew. This is not my first rodeo.
Matthew;Alright. The plan is to meet at the rendezvous point at 2200 hours. Be there.
James;Roger that.
Matthew;After the heist, remember to ditch the equipment and change your clothes. We need to blend in with the crowd.
James;Got it. Is the escape route still the same?
Matthew;No, slight change. I will brief you at the meeting point.
James;Understood, Matthew. Will be there.
Matthew;Stay sharp, James.
James;Always am, Matthew. See you tonight.
Matthew;See you.
