John;We need a plan, any ideas?
Michael;I was thinking about the museum. It has a new exhibit, lots of valuable stuff.
John;Sounds risky, but I like it. How do we get past security?
Michael;I have a contact who can get us the blueprints. We'll find a way in.
John;What about the alarms?
Michael;I know a guy who's good with tech, he can handle it.
John;And the getaway?
Michael;We'll need a fast car, and a driver who knows the city like the back of his hand.
John;I know just the person. Let's meet tomorrow to discuss the details.
Michael;Alright. Be careful, John. We can't afford any mistakes.
