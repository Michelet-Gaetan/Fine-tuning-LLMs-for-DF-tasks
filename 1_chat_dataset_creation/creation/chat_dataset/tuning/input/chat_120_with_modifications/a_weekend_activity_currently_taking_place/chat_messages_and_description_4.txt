James;Hey guys, anyone up for some hiking this weekend?
Brian;I'm in James. What time are we planning to leave?
James;Great Brian! I was thinking we could start early around 7AM. We can beat the crowds then.
Brian;Sounds good to me. Which trail are we taking?
James;I was considering the Blue Ridge trail. It's a bit challenging but the views are worth it.
Brian;I've heard about it. Excited to try it out!
James;Awesome, let's meet at my place then. We can carpool.
Brian;Perfect plan, James. See you tomorrow at 7.
James;Great, see you then Brian. Bring enough water and snacks.
Brian;Will do. Looking forward to it.
