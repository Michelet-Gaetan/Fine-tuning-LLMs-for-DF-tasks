James;Hey Robert, what's the plan for this weekend?
Robert;Hi James, I was thinking of going hiking. Are you up for it?
James;Sounds like a great idea. Where are we headed?
Robert;I was thinking the Boulder Ridge Trail. It's supposed to be beautiful this time of year.
James;Sounds perfect. What time do we leave?
Robert;How about 7am? We can beat the crowd.
James;Sounds good. I'll bring some snacks.
Robert;Great, I'll bring the drinks.
James;Looking forward to it, buddy.
Robert;Same here. See you tomorrow.
