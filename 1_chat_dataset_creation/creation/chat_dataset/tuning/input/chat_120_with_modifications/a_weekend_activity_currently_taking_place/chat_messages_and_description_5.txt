James;Hey Robert, are you up for a hike this weekend?
Robert;Sure James, sounds like a great idea. Where are we headed?
James;I was thinking about the new trail at the National Park. What do you think?
Robert;Oh, I've heard about that one. Sounds challenging but fun. What time should we meet?
James;Let's meet at 7:30 am. We can have breakfast on our way there.
Robert;7:30 am sounds good. I will bring some sandwiches and drinks.
James;Perfect! Don't forget your hiking boots and a jacket. It might be chilly.
Robert;Got it. Looking forward to it. See you on Saturday.
James;See you Robert. Excited about our adventure.
