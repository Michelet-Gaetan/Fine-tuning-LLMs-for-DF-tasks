Michael;Hey James, are you at the park yet?
James;Just arrived, Michael. It's packed but I found a good spot near the lake.
Michael;Great, I'm on my way. I have the frisbees and snacks.
James;Awesome. Don't forget the water bottles.
Michael;Got them, and I also brought some sunscreen. It's really sunny today.
James;Good thinking. See you in a bit.
Michael;Sure thing, be there soon.
