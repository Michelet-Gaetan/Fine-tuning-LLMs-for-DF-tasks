Robert;Yes, I thought I'd check it out. Do you want to join me?
James;Sounds like a plan. What time?
Robert;Let's meet at 10:30 am. Is that ok for you?
James;Perfect. I'll see you then. We can grab a coffee after.
Robert;Great. Looking forward to it. See you soon.
James;See you there. Don't forget to bring your reusable bags!
