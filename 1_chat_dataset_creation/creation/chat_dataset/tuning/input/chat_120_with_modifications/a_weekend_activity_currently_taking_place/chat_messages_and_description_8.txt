James;Hey guys, anyone up for a hike this weekend?
Robert;Sounds good to me. Where do you suggest?
James;I was thinking about the old trail up to Crystal Peak.
Mary;That's a bit steep for me guys.
John;We could take the new trail. It's longer, but less steep.
James;That's a great idea John. What do you think Robert?
Robert;I'm fine with either. Let's go with the new trail for Mary's sake.
Mary;Thanks guys! I appreciate it.
James;No problem Mary. So it's decided then. We meet at the trailhead at 8am on Saturday.
Robert;See you all on Saturday.
John;Looking forward to it.
Mary;Me too. Thanks again guys.
