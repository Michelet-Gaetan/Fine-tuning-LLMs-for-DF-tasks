John;Hey guys, anyone up for a hike this weekend?
Michael;Sure John, I'd love to. Any particular location in mind?
John;I was thinking about the Whispering Pines trail. It's quite beautiful this time of the year.
Robert;Count me in! I've heard a lot about the Whispering Pines trail but never got a chance to visit.
Michael;Great! Let's plan it out then. What time should we start?
John;How about we meet at the trailhead at 8 AM?
Robert;Sounds perfect! I'll bring some snacks.
Michael;Great, I'll bring water and a first aid kit. Just in case.
John;Perfect, see you guys on Saturday then!
Robert;See you guys!
Michael;Looking forward to it, see you all on Saturday.
