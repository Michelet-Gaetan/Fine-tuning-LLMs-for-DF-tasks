James;Hey John, have you started that oil painting yet?
John;Hi James, yeah started it last week. Working on the landscape right now.
James;That's great! What are you using as a reference?
John;I'm using a photo I took last summer in the mountains.
James;Sounds beautiful. Remember, oil painting is about layers. Don't rush.
John;Absolutely, I'm starting with thin layers and gradually building up.
James;Good technique. Remember to keep your brushes clean too.
John;Definitely, I've got a pot of linseed oil for cleaning.
James;Perfect. Keep me updated on the progress, would love to see it when it's done.
John;Will do, thanks for the tips James.
