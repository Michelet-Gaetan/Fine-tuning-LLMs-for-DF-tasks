John;Hey Michael, have you started with your model train set yet?
Michael;Yes John, I just started last weekend. It's more complex than I thought.
John;I can imagine. I've seen some really intricate ones at the hobby store.
Michael;I bought a starter kit. It has everything I need for a basic setup.
John;That's a good start. Did it come with instructions?
Michael;Yes, it did. But I also watched some YouTube tutorials for extra help.
John;YouTube is indeed a great help. How far along are you?
Michael;I've set up the tracks and the train. Now working on the surrounding landscape.
John;Sounds like fun. Keep me posted on your progress.
Michael;Sure will. I hope to have it completed by next weekend.
