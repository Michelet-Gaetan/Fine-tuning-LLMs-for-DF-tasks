James;We need to plan this carefully. The mansion is heavily guarded.
Robert;Agreed. We need a solid plan. Any ideas?
Michael;I've heard the security shifts change at 2 AM. That might be our window.
John;Good intel, Michael. We should also consider the alarm system.
David;I've been researching. The mansion uses the Zeta 3000 system. It's tough but not impossible to crack.
William;We should probably get a specialist for that.
Robert;I know a guy who might be able to help, goes by the name 'Snake'.
James;That's a start. Let's meet tomorrow, same time, and discuss further.
Michael;Sounds like a plan. Let's do this, guys.
John;Alright. Stay safe, everyone.
