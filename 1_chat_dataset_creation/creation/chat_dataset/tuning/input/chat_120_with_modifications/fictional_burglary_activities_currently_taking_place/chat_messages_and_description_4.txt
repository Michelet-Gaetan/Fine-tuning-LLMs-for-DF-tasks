John;Hey, did anyone check out that mansion on Oak Street?
Robert;Yes, John. Looks promising. Quiet neighborhood, wealthy owners.
Jessica;I agree with Robert. Also, it seems like the owners are away for a couple of weeks.
Daniel;But we need to be cautious. There's a security system installed.
Mary;I know someone who can help us bypass it.
Thomas;Good, Mary. Let's plan things out carefully.
John;Agree with Thomas. Let's meet tonight to discuss this further.
