James;Hey Mark, did you finish that report for the meeting tomorrow?
Mark;Yes James, I finished it last night. I'll send it over to you shortly.
James;Great, thanks Mark. I've been tied up all day with client calls.
Mark;No problem at all James. I understand how busy things can get.
James;I appreciate your understanding. Do you need anything from my end for the presentation?
Mark;No, I think I've got everything covered. But I'll let you know if something comes up.
James;Sounds good. Have a great evening, Mark.
Mark;You too, James. Talk to you tomorrow.
