David;Hey guys, how's everyone doing today?
Jennifer;I'm doing great, just finished my morning workout. How about you, David?
David;I'm good, Jennifer. Just about to start my work day. What's your plan for today, Mark?
Mark;I'll probably spend my day working on the project. How about you, David?
David;Probably the same as you, Mark. Just got a bunch of deadlines to meet.
Jennifer;Deadlines are the worst. But let's get through it, guys!
Mark;Agreed, Jennifer. Let's crush it!
David;Absolutely. Let's get this bread, team.
