James;Hey, have you managed to secure the lab location?
Robert;Yes, I found a spot in the industrial district. It's secluded and perfect for our operation.
James;Great. What about the raw materials? Any luck with those?
Robert;I have a source but it's a bit risky. They're asking a lot of questions.
James;We can't afford to raise any suspicion. Maybe we should look elsewhere.
Robert;I agree. I'll start searching immediately.
James;Good. Remember, we need to be careful every step of the way.
Robert;Understood. I'll make sure everything stays under the radar.
