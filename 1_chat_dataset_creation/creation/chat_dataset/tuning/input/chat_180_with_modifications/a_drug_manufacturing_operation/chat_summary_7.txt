Robert, John, Mary, and Michael are discussing the details of a drug manufacturing operation.;Robert notifies the others that he did research for their project and needs to set up a specific lab to manufacture drugs. Mary asks for more details, and Robert explains they would need chemistry equipment such as a sterilizer, a rotatory evaporator, and an HPLC. Michael and John wonder about the acquisition of the equipment, and Robert states that he knows a supplier and that it would cost $100'000. Given the importance of the investment, they agree to conduct more research to determine if there is a potential market before buying anything. John finally asks to meet again one week later.;The conversation involves four individuals: Robert, John, Mary, and Michael, discussing a potential drug manufacturing operation. Robert initiates the conversation by revealing his research into the necessary lab setup. He lists the required equipment: a sterilizer, a rotary evaporator, and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system, estimating the cost to be around $100,000. Mary and Michael express concern about the significant investment, insisting on the need to research potential markets before moving forward with the purchase. The conversation concludes with Robert agreeing to investigate potential markets and the group deciding to reconvene in a week to discuss their findings and potential next steps.;The conversation involves four individuals: Robert, John, Mary, and Michael, discussing a potential drug manufacturing operation.
