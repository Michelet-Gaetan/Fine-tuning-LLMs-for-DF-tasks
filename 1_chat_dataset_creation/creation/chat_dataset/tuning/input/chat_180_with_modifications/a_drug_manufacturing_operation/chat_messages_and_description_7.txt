Robert;Hey guys, I've been doing some research on this new project.
John;Interesting Robert, what have you found?
Robert;We need a specific lab setup for the drug manufacturing operation.
Mary;What kind of setup are we talking about here?
Robert;We'll need to acquire some specialized equipment. A sterilizer, a rotary evaporator, and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system.
Michael;Where can we get these?
Robert;I know a supplier who can get us what we need, but it's going to cost.
John;How much are we talking about here?
Robert;Around $100,000 for everything.
Mary;That's a lot of money. We need to make sure we have a market for this before we invest.
Michael;Agreed. We need to do more research before we proceed.
Robert;I'll look into potential markets and report back.
John;Sounds like a plan. Let's reconvene in a week.
