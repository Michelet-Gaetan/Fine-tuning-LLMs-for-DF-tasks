Robert;Hey John, how's the new project?
John;Hello Robert, it's going well. We're almost ready for the first stage.
Robert;Excellent, what's the timeline we're looking at?
John;We should be ready to start production in about two weeks.
Robert;Great, keep me updated on the progress. Any challenges so far?
John;There are a few minor issues but nothing we can't handle. The team is working round the clock.
Robert;Good to hear. Let's keep everything smooth and low-key, as always.
John;Absolutely, Robert. We're on top of it.
Robert;Alright John, let's touch base again next week. Keep up the good work.
John;Will do, Robert. Talk to you soon.
