David;Hey Karen, are you available for a meeting next week?
Karen;Sure David, what day are you thinking of?
David;How about Monday, at 10am?
Karen;I'm afraid I have another meeting at that time. Can we do it in the afternoon instead?
David;That works for me. How about 2pm?
Karen;Perfect! Let's lock that in. Where will the meeting be held?
David;It's going to be in the conference room on the 4th floor.
Karen;Great, see you then.
David;See you Karen. I'll send you a calendar invite shortly.
Karen;Thanks David. Looking forward to our meeting.
