Matthew;Hi Sandra, I need to schedule an appointment.
Sandra;Sure Matthew, what day are you thinking about?
Matthew;I was thinking about next Tuesday, is that possible?
Sandra;I'm afraid Tuesday is fully booked. Would Wednesday work for you?
Matthew;Yes, that's fine. What time slots do you have available?
Sandra;I have slots at 10 am, 2 pm, and 4 pm. Which one suits you best?
Matthew;The 2 pm slot works best for me.
Sandra;Great! I have booked you in for next Wednesday at 2 pm. See you then.
Matthew;Thank you Sandra, see you then.
Sandra;You're welcome Matthew. If anything changes, let me know.
