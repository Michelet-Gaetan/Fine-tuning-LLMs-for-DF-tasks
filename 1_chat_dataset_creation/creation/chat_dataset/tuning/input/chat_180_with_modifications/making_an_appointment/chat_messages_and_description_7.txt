Michael;Hello everyone, I was thinking we should have a meeting to discuss the upcoming project. What do you think?
John;I agree, Michael. We need to sort out a few things before we proceed.
Elizabeth;That sounds like a good idea. When are we thinking?
Michael;How about next Monday at 10am?
John;I'm free at that time.
Elizabeth;I have a prior engagement at that time. Can we do it in the afternoon?
Michael;Sure, how about 2pm?
John;That works for me.
Elizabeth;Perfect. 2pm it is.
Michael;Great. I'll send out a calendar invite. See you then.
