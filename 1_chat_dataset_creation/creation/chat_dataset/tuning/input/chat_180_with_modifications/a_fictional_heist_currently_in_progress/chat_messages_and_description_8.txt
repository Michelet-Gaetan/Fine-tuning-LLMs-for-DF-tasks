John;The vault code has changed. Any idea what the new one might be?
Robert;No idea. We'll need to improvise.
Mary;I might be able to hack the security system and reset it.
John;That would be great, Mary. How long do you need?
Mary;Give me about 15 minutes.
Robert;Alright. We'll cover you.
John;Michael, keep an eye on the exits. We don't want any surprises.
Michael;Got it, John. Exits are under control.
Robert;Time's running out. How's it going, Mary?
Mary;Almost there. Just a few more minutes.
Robert;We don't have a few more minutes. Hurry up!
Mary;Got it! The code has been reset.
John;Well done, Mary. Let's move, everyone.
