William;Hey John, I've got an exciting business opportunity for you.
John;Really William? What's it about?
William;It involves investing in a rare gemstone mine in Africa. Low investment, high returns.
John;Sounds interesting. How much is the initial investment?
William;Just $10,000. And you'll see returns in just a month.
John;That's a lot of money, William. How can you guarantee the returns?
William;John, trust me. I've seen the paperwork and met the mine owner.
John;Well, I need to see some proof before I invest such a huge amount.
William;Sure, I'll email you the details.
John;Okay, I'll wait for your mail. But I'm not promising anything until I'm fully convinced.
