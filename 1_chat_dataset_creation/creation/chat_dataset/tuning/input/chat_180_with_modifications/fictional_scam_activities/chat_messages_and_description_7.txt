John;Hey guys, have you heard about that new investment opportunity?
Robert;No, John. What's it about?
John;It's this new company offering 200% returns in just a month.
Michael;Sounds sketchy, John. Did you do any research on them?
John;Not really. Their website looks professional though.
Robert;John, please don't tell me you're considering this. It's obviously a scam.
Michael;I agree with Robert. John, you should be careful.
John;I don't know, guys. It's tempting.
Robert;John, remember the golden rule, if it's too good to be true, then it probably is.
Michael;Yes, and do some serious research before even thinking about investing.
