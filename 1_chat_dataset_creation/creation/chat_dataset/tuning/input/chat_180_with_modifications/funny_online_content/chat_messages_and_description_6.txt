John;Hey Michael, have you seen the latest episode of 'Bad Jokes Battle' on YouTube?
Michael;No, I haven't. Is it worth it?
John;Absolutely! They had a 'puns about bread' segment that had me rolling.
Michael;Oh, sounds fun. I'll check it out.
John;Make sure you do, and let me know what you think!
Michael;Sure thing, John.
John;By the way, there's this hilarious meme page on Instagram, 'The Comic Strip'.
Michael;I think I've heard of it. They post daily, right?
John;Yes, that's the one. Their content is really funny, you should follow them.
Michael;Alright, I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the recommendation, John.
John;No problem. Always happy to share a laugh.
