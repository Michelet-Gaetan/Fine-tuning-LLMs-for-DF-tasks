Alex;Hey guys, have you listened to the new album by The Weeknd?
Sydney;Yeah, I did. His sound has really evolved, I love it!
Salik;I haven't yet. Is it worth a listen?
Aliyah;Definitely, Salik. He has really outdone himself this time.
Chester;I'm more of a classic rock guy, but I'll give it a listen.
Alex;That's the spirit, Chester. Music is all about exploring different genres.
Sydney;True, Alex. By the way, has anyone been to a live concert recently?
Salik;No, but I'm planning to attend the Jazz festival next month.
Aliyah;That sounds exciting, Salik. I wish I could join.
Chester;I attended a Metallica concert last year. It was epic!
