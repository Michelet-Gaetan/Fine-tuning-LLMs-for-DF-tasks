Jason;Hey team, I've been thinking about our next target. What do you all think about the old mansion on Main Street?
Desiree;Sounds promising, Jason. But isn't it rumored to be haunted?
Katherine;That's just a myth, Desiree. I think it could be a good idea. We need to plan carefully though.
Ronda;I agree with Katherine. We need to ensure we have all exit points covered.
Mario;I can handle the security systems. But we need someone on the lookout too.
Jason;Good point, Mario. Desiree, could you handle that?
Desiree;Sure, Jason. I'll keep an eye out for any unexpected surprises.
Katherine;Let's meet tomorrow to discuss the plan in detail.
Ronda;Works for me. Let's keep everything low-key as usual.
Mario;Agreed. See you all tomorrow.
