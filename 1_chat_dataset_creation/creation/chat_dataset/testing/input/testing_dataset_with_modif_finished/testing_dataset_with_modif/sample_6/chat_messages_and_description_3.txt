Jason;Hey guys, I just finished reading 'The Alchemist'. Absolutely loved it!
Desiree;Oh, I love Paulo Coelho's work! Have you read 'Brida' yet, Jason?
Katherine;I have heard a lot about 'The Alchemist', but never got around to reading it. What's it about, Jason?
Jason;It's about a young shepherd named Santiago who embarks on a journey to find a worldly treasure. But, along the way, he discovers himself.
Ronda;Sounds interesting. I might give it a read.
Mario;I prefer non-fiction. Currently reading 'Sapiens' by Yuval Noah Harari. It's mind-blowing!
Desiree;I've heard great things about 'Sapiens', Mario. What's it about?
Mario;It's about the history of humankind, right from the evolution of Homo Sapiens to the present day. It presents some thought-provoking perspectives.
Katherine;Wow, that sounds intriguing, Mario. I'll add it to my reading list.
Ronda;I'm into mystery novels. Just started with 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.
Jason;That's a great book, Ronda. You're in for a treat!
Desiree;I'll have to check that out too. So many books, so little time!
Katherine;Tell me about it, Desiree. My reading list keeps growing!
Jason;Haha, same here. Well, happy reading everyone!
