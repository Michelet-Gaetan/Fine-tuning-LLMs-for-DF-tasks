Helen;Hey Karen, how's your brother doing?
Karen;Hey Helen, he's doing well. Just started a new job.
Helen;Oh that's great! How is he finding it?
Karen;He's enjoying it so far. It's a big change from his old job, but he's adapting.
Helen;That's good to hear. And what about your sister?
Karen;She's good too, thanks for asking. She just moved to a new city for her studies.
Helen;Your siblings seem to be doing really well. You must be proud.
Karen;Yes, I am. They've worked hard to get where they are.
Helen;I can imagine. My siblings are also a big part of my life.
Karen;It's always nice to have siblings to share your life with, isn't it?
