Helen;Hey Karen, have you read any good books lately?
Karen;Yes, Helen. I just finished reading "The Silent Patient". It was an amazing psychological thriller!
Helen;Oh, I've heard about that one. It's by Alex Michaelides, right?
Karen;Yes, that's the one. I couldn't put it down, the plot twists were so unexpected!
Helen;That sounds like a book I would enjoy. I love thrillers with unexpected plot twists.
Karen;Then you should definitely give it a try. What are you currently reading?
Helen;I'm reading "Educated" by Tara Westover. It's a memoir and it's really gripping!
Karen;Oh, I read that last year. It's an incredibly inspiring story.
Helen;It really is. Tara's journey is so powerful and moving.
Karen;Let's make a book club! We can share and discuss books we've read.
Helen;That's a great idea Karen! I'm in. Let's do it.
