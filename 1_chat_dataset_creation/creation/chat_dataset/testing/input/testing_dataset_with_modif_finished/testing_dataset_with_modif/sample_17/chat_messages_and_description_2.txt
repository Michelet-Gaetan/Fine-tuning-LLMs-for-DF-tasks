Helen;Hey Karen, how are you finding high school so far?
Karen;Hi Helen! It's been a bit overwhelming, but I'm managing. How about you?
Helen;I know what you mean. It's a lot different from middle school. I'm doing okay though. Just trying to keep up with all the homework.
Karen;Right? I didn't expect so much work. Are you involved in any clubs or sports?
Helen;Yeah, I joined the debate team. It's pretty fun. Are you in any?
Karen;I'm thinking about joining the art club. I've always enjoyed painting and sketching.
Helen;That sounds great! You're really good at art. It would be a good outlet for you.
Karen;Thanks, Helen! That's really sweet of you to say. Maybe we can study together sometime?
Helen;That sounds like a great idea, Karen. I'd love that. We can help each other out.
Karen;Perfect! Let's plan for that. I'll message you about it later. Thanks, Helen.
