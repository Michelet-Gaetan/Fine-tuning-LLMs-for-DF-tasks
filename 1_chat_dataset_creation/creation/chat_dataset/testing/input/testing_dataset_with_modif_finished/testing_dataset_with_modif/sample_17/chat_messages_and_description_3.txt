Helen;Hi Karen, how's the weather over there?
Karen;Hi Helen! It's a bit chilly, but clear skies. How about where you are?
Helen;It's actually quite warm here, sunny with a few clouds.
Karen;Oh, that sounds lovely. I miss the sunshine.
Helen;I can imagine. How's the forecast looking for the rest of the week?
Karen;It's supposed to be a bit warmer, but still mostly cloudy. No rain though, which is good.
Helen;That's definitely a silver lining. It's supposed to be sunny all week here.
Karen;Lucky you! I'll have to visit sometime.
Helen;You're always welcome! Let's hope for good weather when you do.
Karen;That would be great. Fingers crossed.
