Thomas;Hey Kristopher, hope you're doing well. I was hoping we could set up an appointment to discuss our project.
Kristopher;Sure Thomas. What day are you thinking?
Thomas;I was thinking sometime next week. How about Wednesday?
Kristopher;Wednesday works for me. What time were you thinking?
Thomas;How does 2PM sound to you?
Kristopher;2PM sounds perfect. Where will we be meeting?
Thomas;I was thinking we could meet at our usual coffee shop. Does that work for you?
Kristopher;Yes, the coffee shop works great. I'll see you there.
Thomas;Great! I'll see you next Wednesday at 2PM at the coffee shop.
Kristopher;Looking forward to it, Thomas. See you then.
