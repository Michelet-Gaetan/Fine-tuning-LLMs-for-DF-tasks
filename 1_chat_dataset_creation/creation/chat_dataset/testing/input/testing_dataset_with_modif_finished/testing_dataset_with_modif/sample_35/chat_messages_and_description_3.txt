Thomas;Hey Kristopher, have you tried out the new Call of Duty?
Kristopher;Not yet, Thomas. Is it any good?
Thomas;I think it's amazing! The graphics and gameplay are much better.
Kristopher;Sounds good. I've been playing a lot of Fortnite recently.
Thomas;I've never really got into Fortnite. I prefer the realism in Call of Duty.
Kristopher;Fair enough. Each to their own I guess.
Thomas;Exactly. So, are you planning on trying the new Call of Duty?
Kristopher;I think I will, especially after hearing your thoughts about it.
Thomas;Awesome! Let me know when you do. We could play online together.
Kristopher;Sounds like a plan, Thomas. I'll give it a go this weekend.
