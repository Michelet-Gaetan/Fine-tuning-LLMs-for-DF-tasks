Robert;Good morning, Tiana. How are you today?
Tiana;Morning Robert, I'm good, just getting ready for work. How about you?
Robert;I'm doing well, thank you. Just had my morning coffee and about to start working.
Tiana;That's good. What's on the agenda today?
Robert;I have a few meetings and need to finish a report. How about you?
Tiana;I need to complete a project and then get to some email backlog. It's going to be a busy day.
Robert;Sounds like it. Remember to take breaks when you need them.
Tiana;I will. You do the same, Robert. We often forget to take care of ourselves in the hustle.
Robert;You're absolutely right, Tiana. Let's promise to look after ourselves better.
Tiana;Deal. Have a productive day, Robert.
Robert;You too, Tiana. Catch you later.
