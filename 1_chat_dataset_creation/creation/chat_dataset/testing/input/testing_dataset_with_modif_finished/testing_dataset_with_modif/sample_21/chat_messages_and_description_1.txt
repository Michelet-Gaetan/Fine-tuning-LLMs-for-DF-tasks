Robert;Hey Tiana, how have you been feeling lately?
Tiana;Hi Robert, I have been feeling a bit under the weather lately.
Robert;Oh no, what seems to be the problem?
Tiana;I have been having headaches and feeling really tired.
Robert;That doesn't sound good. Have you seen a doctor yet?
Tiana;Not yet, I thought it was just stress from work.
Robert;It could be, but I think you should get a check-up just to be sure.
Tiana;You're right, better safe than sorry. I will book an appointment tomorrow.
Robert;That's a good decision Tiana. Let me know how it goes.
Tiana;I definitely will. Thanks for your concern, Robert.
