Victoria;Hey everyone, has anyone read 'The Great Gatsby'?
Kamrin;Hi Victoria, I have. I found it to be a very intriguing exploration of the American Dream.
Juandiego;I haven't read it. Would you guys recommend it for someone who's more into sci-fi?
Jacqueline;Well, it's not a sci-fi book, Juandiego. But it's a classic worth reading.
Victoria;I agree with Jacqueline. It's not sci-fi but it's still a fascinating read.
Kamrin;Juandiego, maybe you can give it a try and tell us what you think.
Jacqueline;That's a good idea. It's always interesting to hear diverse opinions.
Juandiego;Alright, I'll add it to my reading list and let you know my thoughts when I'm done.
Victoria;Sounds like a plan, looking forward to hearing your thoughts, Juandiego!
