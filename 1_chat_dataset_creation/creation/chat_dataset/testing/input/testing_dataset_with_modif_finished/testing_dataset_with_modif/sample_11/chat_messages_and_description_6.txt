Nicholas;Hey Scharron, any plans for the weekend?
Scharron;Not sure yet, maybe just some Netflix and chill. How about you?
Nicholas;I'm thinking about going hiking, the weather should be good.
Scharron;That sounds fun, where are you planning to go?
Nicholas;Probably the local national park, wanna join?
Scharron;I'd love to, but I am not feeling too adventurous lately.
Nicholas;No problem, maybe next time. We could do a movie night instead?
Scharron;Sure, that sounds great. Any movie suggestions?
Nicholas;How about 'The Shawshank Redemption'? It's a classic.
Scharron;Oh, I love that movie. It's a deal then.
Nicholas;Great, see you on Saturday then.
Scharron;Looking forward to it, see you!
