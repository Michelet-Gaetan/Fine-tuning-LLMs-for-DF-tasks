Nicholas;Hey Scharron, what's your favorite sport?
Scharron;Hey Nicholas! I really like basketball. How about you?
Nicholas;I'm more into soccer actually. 
Scharron;That's cool! Do you play or just watch?
Nicholas;I play occasionally, but mostly watch. 
Scharron;I used to play basketball in college.
Nicholas;Oh really? That's impressive. 
Scharron;Yeah, it was a great experience.
Nicholas;I bet it was. Do you still play now?
Scharron;Not as much as I'd like to, but I try to keep up with it.
Nicholas;That's nice. It's important to keep doing what you love.
Scharron;Absolutely. Maybe we can play a game sometime!
Nicholas;That sounds like a great idea!
