Robert;Hey Joe, have you seen the latest video on FunnyVids.com?
Joe;No, not yet. What's it about?
Robert;It's a compilation of the funniest pet fails. It's hilarious!
Joe;Oh, I'm gonna have to check that out. I love a good pet fail.
Robert;You should. There's one with a cat trying to jump on a shelf, but it totally misses. I almost choked on my coffee.
Joe;Haha, sounds like my cat. I'll definitely watch it during my break.
Robert;Let me know what you think. I can't stop laughing.
Joe;Sure, looking forward to a good laugh.
Robert;I'm sure you'll have more than one. Enjoy!
