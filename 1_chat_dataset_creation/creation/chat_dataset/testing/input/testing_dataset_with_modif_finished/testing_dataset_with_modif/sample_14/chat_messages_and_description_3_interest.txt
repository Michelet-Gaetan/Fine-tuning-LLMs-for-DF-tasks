Brody;Just got the floor plans, how are we looking on the security system, Eric?
Eric;Still working on it. The system is more complicated than we thought.
John;We need to figure it out soon, we're on a tight schedule here.
Eric;I know, John. I'm doing my best here.
Brody;Let's stay focused, guys. Eric, you've got this. 
Eric;Thanks, Brody. I think I've got a lead here. 
John;Good. We need to be inside and out before the guards switch shifts.
Brody;Remember, no one gets hurt. That's the rule.
Eric;Of course. I've just cracked the system. We're all set.
John;Perfect. Let's meet up and finalize everything.
Brody;See you guys in an hour. Let's make this count.
