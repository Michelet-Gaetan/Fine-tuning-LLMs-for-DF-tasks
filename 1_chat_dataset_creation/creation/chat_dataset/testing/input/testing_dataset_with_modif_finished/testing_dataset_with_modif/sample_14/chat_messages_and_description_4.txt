Brody;Hey guys, I'm thinking of getting a new pet. Any suggestions?
Eric;What about a dog, Brody? They're loyal and great companions.
John;True, but they require a lot of care and time. How about a cat, Brody? They're more independent.
Brody;I do like cats. But I'm also considering something a little more unconventional. Like a reptile.
Eric;A reptile could be cool! Maybe a bearded dragon or a gecko?
John;Reptiles are definitely unique pets. But remember they also have specific needs, like regulated temperatures.
Brody;Yeah, I'll have to do some research. Thanks for the suggestions, guys.
Eric;No problem, Brody. Let us know what you decide!
John;Yeah, good luck with your decision, Brody!
