Joseph asks Elizabeth and Justin about their latest good readings.;In this conversation, Joseph initiated a discussion about books with Elizabeth and Justin in the WhatsApp group "Book Lovers Unite". Elizabeth shared that she recently finished reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover, a memoir about a woman overcoming her strict and abusive upbringing. Justin mentioned that he is currently reading 'The Silent Patient', a psychological thriller about a woman's silence after allegedly murdering her husband. Joseph expressed interest in this book due to its reputed twist ending. He then asked for lighter book recommendations, to which Elizabeth suggested 'Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine' and Justin recommended 'A Man Called Ove'. Both of these books are lighter reads with themes around friendship, self-discovery, and unexpected change.
