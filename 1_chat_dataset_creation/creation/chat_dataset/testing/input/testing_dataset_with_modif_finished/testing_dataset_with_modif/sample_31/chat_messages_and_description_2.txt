Paul;Hey Amelia, how are you?
Amelia;I'm good, Paul! How about you?
Paul;I'm doing well, thanks. How's everyone at home?
Amelia;They're all doing well. Mom and Dad send their love.
Paul;That's nice to hear. How's little Timmy doing in school?
Amelia;He's doing great. He scored an A+ in his math test last week.
Paul;That's my nephew! Always knew he had it in him.
Amelia;Yeah, he's a smart kid. He takes after his uncle.
Paul;I'm flattered, Amelia. How's work for you?
Amelia;It's going well. A bit busy these days but manageable.
Paul;That's good to hear. Let's catch up soon.
Amelia;Sounds like a plan. Let's do it.
