Jayden;Hey guys, have you started applying for colleges yet?
Joy;No, I'm still deciding between a few. How about you, Kathleen?
Kathleen;Same here, Joy. There are so many options, it's overwhelming.
Jayden;I know right! I'm leaning towards a smaller college, less stress I guess.
Joy;That's a good point, Jayden. But what about the opportunities at larger colleges?
Kathleen;I think both have their pros and cons. It ultimately depends on what you want from your college experience.
Jayden;True. I'm looking for a balance between academics and social life.
Joy;That makes sense. I guess it's important to consider all factors before making a decision.
Kathleen;Absolutely. Let's take our time and make the right choice.
