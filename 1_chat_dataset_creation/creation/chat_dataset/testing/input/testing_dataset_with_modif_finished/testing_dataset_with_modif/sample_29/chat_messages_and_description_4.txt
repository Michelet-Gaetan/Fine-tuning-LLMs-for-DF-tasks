Willie;Hi Mary, have you ever pondered over the concept of existentialism?
Mary;Hi Willie, indeed. It's quite an intriguing concept. It's the idea that individuals are free and responsible for their own choices and actions, right?
Willie;Exactly, Mary. It emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and subjectivity.
Mary;But don't you think it can lead to a sense of isolation or despair, considering the emphasis on individual freedom and the lack of external forces?
Willie;That's a valid point, Mary. However, it also gives the individual the freedom to define their own purpose in life.
Mary;True, Willie. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. A balance between individual freedom and understanding the consequences of our choices.
Willie;Well said, Mary. I think that's the crux of existentialism - understanding that freedom comes with responsibility.
Mary;Indeed, Willie. It's a fascinating topic to ponder on.
