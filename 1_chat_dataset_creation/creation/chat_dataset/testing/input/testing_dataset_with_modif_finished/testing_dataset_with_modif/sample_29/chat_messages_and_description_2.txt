Willie;Hi Mary, hope you're doing well.
Mary;Hey Willie, I'm good. How about you?
Willie;I'm well, thanks. I was wondering if you've picked up any new hobbies lately.
Mary;Actually, yes. I've started painting recently. How about you?
Willie;That's cool. I've always admired people who can paint. I've started gardening.
Mary;That's interesting. What kind of plants are you growing?
Willie;Mainly vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers. It's been really rewarding.
Mary;Sounds fun. I've been thinking of starting a small herb garden myself.
Willie;I'd highly recommend it. I can help you get started if you want.
Mary;That would be great, Willie. Thanks.
Willie;You're welcome, Mary. Looking forward to it.
