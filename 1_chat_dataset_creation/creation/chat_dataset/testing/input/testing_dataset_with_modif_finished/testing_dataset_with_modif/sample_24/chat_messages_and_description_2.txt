Meredith;Hey guys, have you heard the new album from The Weeknd?
Roy;Not yet, is it any good?
Meredith;I think it's fantastic. Very different from his previous work though.
Steven;I'm more of a classic rock guy. The Weeknd isn't really my cup of tea.
Roy;You should give it a try, Steven. It's always good to explore new genres.
Steven;Maybe I will. Any specific song you guys recommend?
Meredith;I really love 'Save Your Tears'. It has a catchy tune.
Roy;I second that. Also, 'Blinding Lights' is a great track as well.
Steven;Okay, I'll check out those songs and let you guys know what I think.
Meredith;Great! Looking forward to your thoughts, Steven.
Roy;Same here. It's always interesting to hear different perspectives on music.
Steven;Sure thing. Let's chat about this again next week.
