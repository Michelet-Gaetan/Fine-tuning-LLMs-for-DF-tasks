Reba;Hey guys, I've been thinking about our next group adventure. Any thoughts?
Nadir;Great idea, Reba! I think we should visit somewhere exotic.
Ronnie;What about a safari trip to Africa? I've heard it's a unique experience.
Sheree;That sounds awesome, Ronnie. But we also need to consider the budget.
Robert;How about backpacking across Europe? It's affordable and we can explore different cultures.
Reba;I love the idea, Robert! We could start from Spain and make our way to Greece.
Nadir;Sounds like a plan! We should make a list of must-visit places and things to do.
Ronnie;Absolutely, Nadir. Also, we need to check the best time to visit these countries.
Sheree;Yes, and let's not forget about food. We must try local cuisines in each country.
Robert;Agreed, Sheree. I can't wait to try some authentic pizza in Italy.
Reba;Sounds like we have a plan, guys. Let's start preparing for our European adventure.
