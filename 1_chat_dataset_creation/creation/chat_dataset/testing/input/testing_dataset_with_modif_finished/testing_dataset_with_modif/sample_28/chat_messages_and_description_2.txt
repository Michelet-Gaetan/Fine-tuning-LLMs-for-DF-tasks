William;Hey guys, have you seen the new concert lineup?
Sheila;No, I haven't, who's playing?
Herman;I heard that The Rolling Stones are headlining!
William;Yes, that's right, Herman! They also have some great supporting bands.
Sheila;Sounds like a concert we shouldn't miss.
Herman;Definitely! Let's get the tickets as soon as they're available.
William;I agree, we should act fast. They're likely to sell out quickly.
Sheila;I'll set a reminder to check for tickets tomorrow morning.
Herman;Great idea, Sheila. I'll do the same.
William;Awesome, let's hope we get good seats!
Sheila;Fingers crossed. It's going to be a fun night!
Herman;Absolutely, can't wait to see The Rolling Stones live!
William;Same here, it's going to be epic.
