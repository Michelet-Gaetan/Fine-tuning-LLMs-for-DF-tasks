Trinity;Hey Glenda, you got the stuff?
Glenda;Yeah, I have it. When and where?
Trinity;Let's meet at the usual spot. Tomorrow at 9.
Glenda;Alright. But this is the last time, Trinity.
Trinity;What? Why's that?
Glenda;I'm getting out of the business. Too risky.
Trinity;What about the team?
Glenda;They'll manage. This isn't a game anymore, Trinity.
Trinity;You're right. Maybe it's time for a change.
Glenda;Exactly. See you tomorrow, Trinity.
Trinity;See you, Glenda.
