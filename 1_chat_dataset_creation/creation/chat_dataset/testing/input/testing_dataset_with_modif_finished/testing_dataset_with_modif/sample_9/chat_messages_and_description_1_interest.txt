Amanda;Got the package, Paulette?
Paulette;Yeah, just picked it up. Quality seems good this time.
Amanda;Nice. Same spot for the drop-off tomorrow?
Paulette;You got it. Usual time?
Amanda;Make it 3 PM. We need to avoid the heat.
Paulette;Works for me. How many units we talking?
Amanda;10 this round. And keep an eye out, I heard there's some new heat in the area.
Paulette;Already on it. Got a guy keeping watch.
Amanda;Perfect. Let's keep this smooth. We can't afford any slip-ups now.
Paulette;Agreed. Stay sharp, Amanda.
Amanda;Always. See you tomorrow.
