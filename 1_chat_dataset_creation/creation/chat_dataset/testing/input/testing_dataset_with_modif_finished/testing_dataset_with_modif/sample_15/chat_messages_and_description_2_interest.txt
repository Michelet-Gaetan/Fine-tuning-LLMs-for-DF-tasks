David;Hey Thomas, I got an interesting offer for you.
Thomas;Really? What's that about?
David;I got a mail from a Prince in Nigeria. He's offering a huge reward for helping him transfer his inheritance.
Thomas;Haha, that sounds like a classic scam, David.
David;Yeah, I know. But it's tempting, isn't it? Imagine if it was real.
Thomas;No way, it's a well-known scam. Don't even think about it.
David;Just kidding, Thomas. I'm not that naive. But it's fascinating how these scams still exist.
Thomas;I agree, it's because some people still fall for them. Always remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
David;Wise words, Thomas. Thanks for the reminder.
