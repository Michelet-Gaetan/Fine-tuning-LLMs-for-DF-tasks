David;Hey Thomas, how's the weather looking on your end?
Thomas;Hi David, it's quite sunny here. How about at your place?
David;It's quite gloomy here. Looks like it's going to rain.
Thomas;Oh, that's quite the contrast. Make sure to carry an umbrella if you're heading out.
David;Will do, Thomas. Hopefully, it clears up soon.
Thomas;Fingers crossed, David. Stay safe out there.
David;Thanks, Thomas. You too, enjoy the sun.
