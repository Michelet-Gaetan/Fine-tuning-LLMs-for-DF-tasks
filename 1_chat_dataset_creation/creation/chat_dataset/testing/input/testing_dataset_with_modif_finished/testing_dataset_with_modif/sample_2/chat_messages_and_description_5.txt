John;Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?
Peter;I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.
Richard;I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. 
Karen;I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.
Ashley;I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.
John;Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.
Peter;Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.
Richard;That's true. I did that last semester.
Karen;Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.
Ashley;You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.
