Falon;Hey Manuel! How's your weekend going so far?
Manuel;Hi Falon! It's been pretty good. I went for a hike in the morning. How about you?
Falon;That sounds fun! I've been chilling at home, watching some series. Any plans for Sunday?
Manuel;Yes, I plan to visit a museum. Do you have any recommendations?
Falon;You should check out the art museum downtown. They have a new exhibition.
Manuel;That sounds interesting. Will definitely check it out. Thanks, Falon!
Falon;No problem! Enjoy your visit. Let's catch up next week.
Manuel;Sure, sounds like a plan. Have a great weekend, Falon!
Falon;You too, Manuel!
