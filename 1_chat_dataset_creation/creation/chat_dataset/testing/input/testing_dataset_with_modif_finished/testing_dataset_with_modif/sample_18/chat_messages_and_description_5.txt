Parker;Hey guys, have you started looking into your college applications yet?
April;Yeah, I'm so overwhelmed. There are so many options.
Alexander;I've narrowed down my choices to a few universities. Now, it's all about writing the perfect application.
Teegan;I'm stuck on the essay part. How do you even begin to write about 'a significant experience in your life?'
Kim;Maybe start by brainstorming some key moments that had a big impact on you, Teegan.
Parker;That's a good idea, Kim. And remember, it doesn't have to be something huge. It could be something small that changed your perspective.
April;I'm also struggling with financial aid. The forms are so confusing.
Alexander;I can help with that, April. I've been through it with my older sister.
Teegan;That would be great, Alexander. Maybe we can all meet up this weekend to work on our applications together.
Kim;That sounds like a plan. Let's do it.
