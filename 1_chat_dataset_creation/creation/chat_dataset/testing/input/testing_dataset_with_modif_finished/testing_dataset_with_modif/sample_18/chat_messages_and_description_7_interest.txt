Parker;Guys, I think we need to discuss the new formula for the product
April;Absolutely. We've been getting feedback that the quality isn't as high as it used to be
Alexander;That's a big issue. Any problem with the ingredients?
Teegan;As far as I can tell, the ingredients are fine. The issue might be in the process
Kim;I agree with Teegan. It's not the what, it's the how. We should revisit our process
Parker;That's a good point, Kim. We need to ensure we're not cutting corners
April;We also need to think about security. The last thing we want is for this operation to get busted
Alexander;I've got contacts that can help with securing the operation
Teegan;Let's focus on the process first, then we'll sort out security
Kim;Agreed. One thing at a time.
