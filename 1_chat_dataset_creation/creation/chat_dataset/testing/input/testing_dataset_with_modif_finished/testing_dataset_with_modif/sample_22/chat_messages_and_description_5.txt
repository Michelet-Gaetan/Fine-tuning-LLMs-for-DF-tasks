Kenneth;Hey guys, have you checked out the new podcast by Malcolm Gladwell?
Rebecca;Hi Kenneth, not yet. What's it about?
Kenneth;It's called "Revisionist History". It's about events in the past that have been misunderstood or overlooked. It's quite interesting.
Evelyn;Oh, that sounds like something I would enjoy. I love history.
Kenneth;You should definitely check it out then, Evelyn. And you too, Rebecca. I think you'll both like it.
Rebecca;I'll certainly give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendation, Kenneth!
Evelyn;Adding it to my list now. Thanks, Kenneth!
Kenneth;You're welcome! Let me know what you think once you've listened to it.
Rebecca;Will do!
Evelyn;Same here!
