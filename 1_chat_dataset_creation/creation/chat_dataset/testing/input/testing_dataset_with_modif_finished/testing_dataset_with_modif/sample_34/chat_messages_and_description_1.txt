Adam;Hey guys, any thoughts on going to the Green Day concert next month?
Shelby;That sounds like a great idea! I haven't been to a concert in ages.
Kyle;I'm in! I've been wanting to see them live.
Leon;Iâ€™m not a big fan of Green Day. What about a different band?
Jessica;Leon, you're always the odd one out! But let's vote on it to be fair.
Adam;Okay, everyone list a band and we'll go with the majority.
Shelby;I'll stick with Green Day.
Kyle;Green Day for me too.
Leon;I'd prefer Metallica.
Jessica;Green Day. Looks like we have a winner, Leon.
Leon;Alright, I'm outnumbered. Green Day it is.
Adam;Great, I'll look for tickets for us.
Shelby;Thanks, Adam. Let's hope they are not sold out!
Kyle;Can't wait for this, it's going to be epic.
Jessica;Agreed, thanks Adam for organizing!
