Clara;Hey Carlton, have you started watching the new season of 'Stranger Things' yet?
Carlton;Not yet, Clara. I've been busy with work. Is it any good?
Clara;I think it's amazing! The plot seems more intense this time. You should really start watching it.
Carlton;I've heard mixed reviews about it. Some say it's not as good as the previous seasons.
Clara;Well, I think it's subjective. I personally loved it. There are some unexpected twists that make it more interesting.
Carlton;Alright, you've convinced me. I'll start watching it this weekend.
Clara;Great! We can discuss the episodes once you've seen them.
Carlton;Sounds good. I'll get back to you once I start watching.
