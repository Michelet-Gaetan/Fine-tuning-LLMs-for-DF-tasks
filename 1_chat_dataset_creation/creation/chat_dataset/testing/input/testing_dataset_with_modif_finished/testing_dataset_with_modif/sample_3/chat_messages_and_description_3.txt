Clara;Hey Carlton, have you heard the new album from The Weeknd?
Carlton;Yes, Clara. I just finished listening to it. It's pretty amazing, don't you think?
Clara;Absolutely! I especially loved the track "Save Your Tears". The lyrics are so deep.
Carlton;I couldn't agree more. But I'm also really into "Blinding Lights". The beat is so catchy.
Clara;True that. I've been playing it on repeat. What do you think about the overall theme of the album?
Carlton;It seems to me that it's about heartbreak and recovery, with a touch of his usual dark style.
Clara;Yes, I also think it's a bit darker than his previous work. But I like it, it's different.
Carlton;Definitely. It's always refreshing when artists try something new and it works.
Clara;Right. By the way, do you have any other music recommendations?
Carlton;If you're into The Weeknd, you might also like Frank Ocean. His music has a similar vibe.
Clara;Thanks, Carlton! I'll check him out.
Carlton;No problem, Clara. Enjoy!
