Clara;Hey Carlton, have you read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' yet?
Carlton;Hey Clara! Yes, I finished it last night. It was an incredibly moving read.
Clara;I'm glad you enjoyed it. What did you think of Scout as a character?
Carlton;I thought Scout was a brilliant character. She provided an innocent and unique perspective to the racial tension in the story.
Clara;Exactly! Her innocence made the events even more poignant. Now, what about '1984'? Have you started that?
Carlton;Not yet, but it's next on my list. I've heard it's quite a thought-provoking book.
Clara;It certainly is. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it. Happy reading!
Carlton;Thanks, Clara! I'll let you know once I've finished it.
