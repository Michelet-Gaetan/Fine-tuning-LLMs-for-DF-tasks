Jaiden, Cindy, Tre, and John are discussing about the 'The Daily' podcast and thinking about launching their own.;The conversation started with Jaiden asking if anyone has listened to the new episode of "The Daily", a popular podcast. Cindy responded that she hadn't yet, prompting Jaiden to express that it was an interesting episode about the impact of technology on society. This piqued Tre's interest, and he expressed the intent to check it out. John asked if the podcast was available on all platforms, to which Jaiden confirmed. The conversation then shifted to Tre suggesting they should start their own podcast. After some deliberation on the topic, they decided to discuss their favorite podcasts and the learnings from them, with an added twist of changing topics every week, similar to a book club. All participants agreed to this idea.
