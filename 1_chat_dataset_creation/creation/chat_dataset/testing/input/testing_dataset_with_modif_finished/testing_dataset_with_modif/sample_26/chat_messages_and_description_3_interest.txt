Jaiden;Hey guys! Have you tried out the new painting techniques I sent last week?
Cindy;Yes, I have! The wet-on-wet technique was quite tricky but fun to learn.
Tre;I'm still struggling with the dry brush technique. Any tips?
John;I found watching some tutorial videos really helpful, Tre. Try that.
Cindy;Also, always remember to use a stiff brush and very little paint for dry brushing.
Jaiden;Great tips, guys! Let's keep practicing and share our artworks next week.
John;Sounds like a plan. Looking forward to it.
Tre;Me too. Happy painting, everyone!
