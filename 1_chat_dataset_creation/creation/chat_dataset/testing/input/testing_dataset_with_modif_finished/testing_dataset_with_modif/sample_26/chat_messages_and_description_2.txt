Jaiden;Hey guys, anyone else listen to the new episode of "The Daily" this morning?
Cindy;Not yet Jaiden. Was it interesting?
Jaiden;Definitely! They had a really good discussion on the impact of technology on society.
Tre;Oh, that sounds intriguing. I'll have to check it out.
John;Is it available on all podcast platforms?
Jaiden;Yes John, it's on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and even their website.
Cindy;I'll definitely give it a listen then.
Tre;Maybe we should start our own podcast, guys.
John;That's not a bad idea Tre. What would we talk about though?
Jaiden;We could discuss our favorite podcasts and what we learned from them.
Cindy;Or we could talk about different topics each week, like a book club but for podcasts.
Tre;I love that idea Cindy.
John;Let's do it. I'm in.
