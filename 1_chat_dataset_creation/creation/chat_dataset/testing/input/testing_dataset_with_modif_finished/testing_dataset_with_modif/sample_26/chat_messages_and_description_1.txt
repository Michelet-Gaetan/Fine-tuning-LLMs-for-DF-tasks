Jaiden;Hey guys, do you have any idea about the math homework?
Cindy;Yes, Jaiden. It's about the quadratic equations we studied in class today.
Tre;I'm still confused about those equations. Can someone explain the formula to me again?
John;Sure Tre, the quadratic formula is: x = [-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a).
Cindy;That's right, John. And 'a' is the coefficient of x^2, 'b' is the coefficient of x, and 'c' is the constant.
Tre;Oh, I see now. Thanks, Cindy and John.
Jaiden;No problem, Tre. Do you guys want to study together for the test next week?
John;That sounds like a good idea, Jaiden. Let's meet up in the library after school tomorrow.
Cindy;I'm in too. I think it would be really helpful.
Tre;Count me in as well. Let's ace this test together!
