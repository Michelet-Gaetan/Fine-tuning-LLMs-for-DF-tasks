Chris;Hey guys, how's everyone doing with their families in this lockdown?
Kenneth;It's quite a challenge, Chris. Homeschooling the kids is not an easy task.
Greyson;Tell me about it, Kenneth. I'm running out of ideas to keep the kids entertained.
Robert;I'm lucky that my kids are all grown up. But, I miss my grandchildren. Can't wait to see them.
Chris;I feel you, Robert. It's been tough on all of us. Let's hope things get better soon.
Kenneth;Yeah, let's stay positive. We're all in this together.
Greyson;Agreed. Let's also plan a virtual get-together for the kids.
Robert;That sounds like a great idea, Greyson. Let's do it.
