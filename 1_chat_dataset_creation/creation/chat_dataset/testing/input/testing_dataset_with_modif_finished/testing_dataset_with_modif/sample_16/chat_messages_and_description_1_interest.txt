Chris;Guys, I've been thinking about a way we could make some quick cash.
Kenneth;Not another one of your get-rich-quick schemes, Chris.
Chris;No, hear me out. This is different.
Greyson;Alright, I'm intrigued. What is it?
Chris;We could set up a fake lottery. All we need is an email list and a convincing story.
Robert;Sounds risky. What if we get caught?
Kenneth;And where would we get an email list?
Greyson;I know a guy who could get us that. 
Robert;Still, isn't this illegal?
Chris;Only if we get caught.
Kenneth;I'm out. This sounds too risky.
Greyson;I'm with Kenneth. It's not worth it.
Robert;Agreed. Chris, maybe it's time for some honest work.
Chris;Alright, I get it. I'll think of something else.
