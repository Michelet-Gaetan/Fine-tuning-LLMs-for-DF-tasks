Rylan;Hi Phyllis, have you ever tried painting?
Phyllis;Hey Rylan, yes, I have tried it a few times. Do you paint?
Rylan;I've started recently. It's really therapeutic.
Phyllis;That's great! What type of painting do you prefer?
Rylan;I'm really enjoying watercolor. There's something about the fluidity that I love.
Phyllis;Yes, watercolor is beautiful. Have you taken any classes, or are you self-taught?
Rylan;I'm mostly self-taught, but I've watched a lot of YouTube tutorials. Do you have any tips?
Phyllis;Just keep practicing, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. That's how we learn.
Rylan;Thanks, Phyllis. I really appreciate your advice.
Phyllis;You're welcome, Rylan. Happy painting!
