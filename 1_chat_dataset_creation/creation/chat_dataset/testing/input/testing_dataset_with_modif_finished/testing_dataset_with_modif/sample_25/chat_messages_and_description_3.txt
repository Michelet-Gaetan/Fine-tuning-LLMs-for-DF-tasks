Rylan;Hey Phyllis, how's it going?
Phyllis;Hi Rylan! I'm doing well, thanks. How about you?
Rylan;I'm good, thanks. I was just watching the basketball game. It's a close one.
Phyllis;Oh, which teams are playing?
Rylan;The Lakers and the Celtics. It's a classic rivalry.
Phyllis;That sounds exciting! Who's leading?
Rylan;The Lakers are up by 3 points right now, but there's still plenty of time left.
Phyllis;I'm rooting for the Celtics. They have a great team this season.
Rylan;They do indeed. But I'm a Lakers fan, so we're on opposite sides for this one!
Phyllis;May the best team win then!
