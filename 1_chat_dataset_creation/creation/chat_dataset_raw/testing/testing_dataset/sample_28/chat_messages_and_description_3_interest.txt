William, Good morning everyone, how are you all doing today?
Sheila, Hey William! I'm doing great, just starting my day with a cup of coffee. How about you?
Herman, Morning everyone! Just got back from my morning run.
William, That's great to hear! I'm just getting ready for work. Herman, you're always so energetic in the morning.
Sheila, I wish I could be as energetic as Herman in the morning! I'm still struggling to keep my eyes open.
Herman, Well, it's not easy, but it feels great once you get into the habit. And coffee helps too.
William, I agree with Herman. A good run and a cup of coffee can do wonders.
Sheila, Maybe I should give it a try tomorrow. You guys are inspiring.
Herman, That's the spirit, Sheila! We'll check on you tomorrow morning to make sure you're up and running.
William, That sounds like a plan. Let's all try to wake up early and start the day with some exercise.
