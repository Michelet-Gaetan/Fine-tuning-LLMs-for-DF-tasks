Joshua,Hey Renea, how's it going with the new math teacher?
Renea,Hi Joshua! She's really good, explains everything clearly. But the homework is quite a lot.
Joshua,Yeah, I've heard she's strict. Think we'll have a lot of tests?
Renea,I guess so. But I think it's better to understand the material than just memorizing it.
Joshua,You're right. Have you started studying for the biology test yet?
Renea,Not yet, but I've gathered all my notes. We should study together, what do you think?
Joshua,That sounds like a good idea, Renea. Let's do it.
