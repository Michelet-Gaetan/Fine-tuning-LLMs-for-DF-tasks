The conversation between Joshua and Renea takes place on a WhatsApp group called "Heist Scenario". The chat starts on 10th May 2022 at 13:45. In this fictional scenario, Joshua initiates a discussion about hypothetical burglary activities, similar to those seen in heist movies. He quizzes Renea on how she would go about bypassing various security measures such as surveillance cameras, laser security, and finally, the vault lock. Renea indulges Joshua's curiosity and responds with her hypothetical strategies, including hacking into the security system, using smoke or dust to reveal lasers, and potentially requiring a safe-cracker for the vault lock.
