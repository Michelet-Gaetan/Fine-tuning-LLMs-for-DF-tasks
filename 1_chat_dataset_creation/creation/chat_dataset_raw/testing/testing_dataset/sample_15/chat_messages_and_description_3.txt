David; Hey Thomas, have you seen the latest Marvel movie?
Thomas; No, not yet. I've been meaning to catch up on them though. Is it any good?
David; Yeah, it's quite good. I think you'd like it. It's a bit different from the previous ones.
Thomas; Oh, in what way?
David; Well, it's a bit darker and more serious. But still has that classic Marvel humor.
Thomas; Sounds interesting. I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the recommendation.
David; No problem. Let me know what you think when you see it.
Thomas; Sure, I'll do that. By the way, have you seen the new Star Wars movie?
David; Yes, I have. Didn't quite like it though.
Thomas; Really? I thought it was pretty good.
David; To each their own, I guess.
