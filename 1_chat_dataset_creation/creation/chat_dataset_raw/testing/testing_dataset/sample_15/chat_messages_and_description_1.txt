David;Hi Thomas, are you up for a trip to Italy this summer?
Thomas;Hey David, That sounds interesting. What cities are we considering?
David;I was thinking Rome, Venice, and maybe Florence. What do you think?
Thomas;That sounds great. But I'd like to add Milan to the list.
David;Sure, Milan sounds good too. We should probably start planning.
Thomas;Agreed. I can look into accommodation and travel within Italy.
David;Great, I'll take care of the flights and itinerary then.
Thomas;Sounds like a plan. Let's start working on this soon.
David;Absolutely, we should meet over the weekend to finalize everything.
Thomas;Perfect, see you then.
