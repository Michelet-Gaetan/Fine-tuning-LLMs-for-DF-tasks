David and Thomas had a discussion in a WhatsApp chat group named "Scam Discussion" that began on April 12, 2022, at 10:15:30. The conversation revolved around a fraudulent scheme. David brought up an email he received from a so-called Nigerian prince who was offering a significant reward in return for help with transferring his inheritance. Thomas immediately recognized this as a well-known scam and cautioned David not to consider it. They both expressed fascination over the fact that such scams continue to exist because people still fall for them. Thomas concluded the conversation with a reminder that if something appears too good to be true, it probably is.
