Mae; Hey Brent, did you finish the math homework?
Brent; Hey Mae, yeah I did. Did you find it difficult too?
Mae; Absolutely, I’m not sure I did the last question right. Can we review it tomorrow?
Brent; Sure, we can go over it before class. I also had a hard time with it.
Mae; Thanks, Brent. Also, have you decided on a topic for the History project?
Brent; Not yet, any suggestions?
Mae; What about the French Revolution? I think we can find a lot of resources on it.
Brent; Sounds good to me. Let’s start researching tomorrow after we review the math homework.
Mae; Perfect! See you tomorrow, Brent.
Brent; See you, Mae.
