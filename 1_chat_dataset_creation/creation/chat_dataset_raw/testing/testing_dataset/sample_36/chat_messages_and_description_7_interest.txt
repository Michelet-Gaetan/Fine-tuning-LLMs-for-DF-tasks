Victoria,"Hey guys, we need to set up an appointment for our group project."
Kamrin,"Sounds good to me. What day were you thinking, Victoria?"
Victoria,"How about next Wednesday at 3PM?"
Juandiego,"I can't make it that day, I have a dentist appointment. Can we do Thursday instead?"
Victoria,"That works for me. Kamrin, Jacqueline, does Thursday work for you?"
Kamrin,"I'm free all day Thursday, so that works for me."
Jacqueline,"I have a meeting until 4PM on Thursday, but I can join you after that."
Victoria,"That's settled then. Let's meet on Thursday at 4:30 PM. Is everyone okay with that?"
Kamrin,"Sounds good to me."
Juandiego,"Works for me too."
Jacqueline,"I'm in. See you guys on Thursday."
Victoria,"Great. Looking forward to it. Let's make sure we come prepared."
