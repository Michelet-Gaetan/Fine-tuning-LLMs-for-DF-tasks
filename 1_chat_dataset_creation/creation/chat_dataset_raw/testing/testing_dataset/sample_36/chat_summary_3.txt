In the conversation, Victoria initiates a discussion about the new Call of Duty video game. Kamrin has already played it and comments positively on the graphics. Juandiego hasn't tried it yet and inquires if it's worth the hype. Jacqueline, who typically prefers RPG games, hasn't tried it either but is open to it based on positive reviews from friends. Victoria reassures Juandiego that the game is worth it and even suggests that Jacqueline might enjoy the improved story mode. Kamrin proposes that they all team up for a multiplayer session. Both Juandiego and Jacqueline agree to try the game, and they decide to plan for a gaming session the following weekend.
