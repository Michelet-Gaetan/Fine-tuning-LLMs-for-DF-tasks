Ashton,"Hey team, I think we have a situation here"
Ryan,"What's up, Ashton?"
Ashton,"I've been hearing about some fictional burglary activities happening around"
Linda,"Fictional? Do you mean in a book or something?"
Ashton,"No, it's a new trend for online role-playing games. People are planning 'burglaries' in their favorite games"
Ryan,"Oh, I see. So, it's not real crime. It's just part of the game"
Linda,"Sounds fun. Which games are these happening in?"
Ashton,"Mostly in open-world games. I've heard about it in Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft"
Lavern,"Interesting. Should we be worried about it?"
Ashton,"Not really. But we should keep an eye on it. It could be a potential issue if it starts to inspire real-world crime"
Ryan,"Agreed. Let's monitor the situation"
Linda,"Good idea. I'll start looking into it"
Lavern,"Me too. We should stay informed about these trends"
Ashton,"Great. Let's touch base in a few days to discuss our findings";
