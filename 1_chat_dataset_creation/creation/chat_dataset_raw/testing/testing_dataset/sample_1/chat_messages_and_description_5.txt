Trinity,Hi Glenda, how have you been feeling lately?
Glenda,Hi Trinity, not so great. I've been feeling really tired and I've had a headache for a few days.
Trinity,Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor?
Glenda,No, I haven't. I thought it was just a regular headache.
Trinity,It might be, but if it's been going on for a few days, it's better to get it checked. You might be dehydrated or it could be a symptom of something else.
Glenda,You're right. I'll make an appointment with my doctor.
Trinity,Great. And make sure you're drinking enough water and eating healthy. That can also make a difference.
Glenda,Definitely. I'll try to improve my diet and water intake.
Trinity,That's good to hear. Let me know what the doctor says, okay?
Glenda,Sure, I will. Thanks for your concern, Trinity.
