Adam,"Hey guys, I'm thinking of getting a pet."
Shelby,"That's great, Adam! Any ideas on what pet you'd like to get?"
Adam,"I'm not sure. I was considering a dog."
Kyle,"Dogs are great companions, Adam. What breed are you thinking of?"
Adam,"A Golden Retriever, maybe. They seem friendly."
Leon,"Golden Retrievers are definitely friendly. But they need a lot of exercise."
Jessica,"That's true, Leon. And they also need a lot of space."
Shelby,"Maybe a cat would be more suitable, Adam? They're easier to take care of."
Kyle,"But cats can be quite aloof, Shelby. They're not as affectionate as dogs."
Jessica,"That's a stereotype, Kyle. My cat is very affectionate."
Leon,"Maybe we should let Adam decide. It's his pet, after all."
Adam,"You guys have given me a lot to think about. Thanks!"
