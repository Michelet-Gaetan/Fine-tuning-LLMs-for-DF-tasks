Parker,"Hey guys, how's the weather where you all are?"
April,"It's pretty cold over here in New York. Snowed a little this morning."
Alexander,"Nice and sunny in California. Couldn't ask for better weather."
Teegan,"It's raining cats and dogs here in London. Wish I was in California right now!"
Kim,"It's windy here in Chicago. The Windy City living up to its name."
Parker,"Sounds like we're all experiencing different weather conditions."
April,"I wish I was experiencing Alexander's weather right now. I miss the sun."
Alexander,"Well, I wouldn't mind a bit of snow. We rarely get that here."
Teegan,"I would trade the rain for snow any day. It's been so gloomy here."
Kim,"And I wouldn't mind a bit of rain. It would be a nice change from the wind."
Parker,"Maybe we should all swap places for a bit."
April,"That sounds like a great idea, Parker."
Alexander,"I'm in. Who wants to come to sunny California?"
Teegan,"I'll swap with you, Alexander. You can have the London rain."
Kim,"And I'll swap with you, April. I could use a bit of snow in my life."
