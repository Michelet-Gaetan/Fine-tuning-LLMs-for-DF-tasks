Jon, "Hey Tracy, how's your new pet rabbit doing?"
Tracy, "Hello Jon! He's doing great, thanks for asking."
Jon, "That's awesome! What's his name?"
Tracy, "His name is Fluffy. He's so adorable!"
Jon, "Fluffy is a cute name. How is he adjusting to his new home?"
Tracy, "He seems to be enjoying it. He's already found his favorite corner to play in."
Jon, "That's wonderful. It's important for pets to feel comfortable in their environment."
Tracy, "Exactly, Jon. And I make sure he gets plenty of exercise and a balanced diet."
Jon, "That's great to hear, Tracy. Are you planning on getting more pets?"
Tracy, "Not at the moment, Jon. Fluffy is quite a handful already!"
Jon, "I can imagine! Pets are a big responsibility but they're worth it."
Tracy, "Absolutely, Jon. They bring so much joy and happiness."
