Robert;"Hello Tiana, are you free to chat about our upcoming trip?"
Tiana;"Hi Robert, sure I am. Do you have any specific plans?"
Robert;"I was thinking about visiting France. Have you been there before?"
Tiana;"Yes, I have. France is beautiful. Do you have any specific cities in mind?"
Robert;"I've always wanted to visit Paris and Nice. What do you think?"
Tiana;"Paris is a must-visit. Nice is also great, especially during the summer."
Robert;"That's great. Do we need any specific documents for traveling there?"
Tiana;"We need our passports, and France requires a tourist visa for stays longer than 90 days."
Robert;"Perfect! I'll start preparing the necessary documents."
Tiana;"Great! Let's discuss more details soon."
