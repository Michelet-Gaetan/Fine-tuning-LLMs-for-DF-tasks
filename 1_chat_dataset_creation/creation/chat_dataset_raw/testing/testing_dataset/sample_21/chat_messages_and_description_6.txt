Robert,Hey Tiana, how's the college application process going?
Tiana,Hey Robert! It's going alright. Just sorting through various colleges.
Robert,That's cool. Any favorites yet?
Tiana,Well, I've been looking at Stanford and Harvard so far.
Robert,Wow, those are great choices! What major are you considering?
Tiana,I'm thinking about computer science. But I also love biochemistry.
Robert,That's interesting. You know, you can always do a double major or choose one as a minor.
Tiana,Yeah, that's true. Just trying to figure out what would be the best fit for me.
Robert,You'll figure it out. What about the deadlines? Are they coming up soon?
Tiana,Yes, they are. I'm working on my essays now.
Robert,If you need any help or someone to proofread, let me know!
Tiana,Thanks, Robert! I might take you up on that.
Robert,No problem, Tiana. Good luck with everything!
Tiana,Thanks, Robert! I'll keep you updated.
Robert,Sure, looking forward to it!
