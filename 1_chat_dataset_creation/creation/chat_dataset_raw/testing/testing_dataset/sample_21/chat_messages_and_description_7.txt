Robert;Hey Tiana, have you listened to the new album by The Weeknd?
Tiana;Hi Robert, yes I have. It's totally different from his previous works.
Robert;I agree. It seems like he's experimenting with a new sound. Did you have a favorite track?
Tiana;I think "Save Your Tears" was pretty good. What about you?
Robert;I quite liked "Blinding Lights". It has a catchy tune.
Tiana;That's true. It's one of those songs that you can't get out of your head.
Robert;Do you think this album will win any awards?
Tiana;It's hard to say. The competition is tough this year. But I think he might win a few.
