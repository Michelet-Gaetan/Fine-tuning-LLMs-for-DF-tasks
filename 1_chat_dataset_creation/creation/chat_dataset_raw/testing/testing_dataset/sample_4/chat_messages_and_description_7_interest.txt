Reba,"Alright team, we have a new job. The target is the National Museum."
Nadir,"Sounds risky, Reba. What's the prize?"
Reba,"A priceless artifact, The Heart of the Ocean. It's worth the risk."
Ronnie,"I'm in. I can handle the security systems."
Sheree,"I'll get us the blueprints of the museum."
Robert,"And I can arrange our getaway vehicle."
Reba,"Excellent. Everyone knows their role. Let's meet at the usual spot tomorrow to iron out the details."
Nadir,"I've got a feeling this is going to be a big one."
Ronnie,"Just another day at the office, Nadir."
Sheree,"Blueprints are in hand. This place is a maze."
Robert,"Got us a van. Plain, inconspicuous, just how we like it."
Reba,"Great work, team. Let's get this done."
