Clara,"Hey Carlton, how are you?"
Carlton,"Hey Clara, I'm doing well. Just a bit stressed about exams."
Clara,"I can relate, these end of year exams are really nerve-wracking."
Carlton,"Yeah, especially the physics exam. I am really struggling with that subject."
Clara,"Have you tried revising with some online resources? There are some good YouTube channels that explain the concepts really well."
Carlton,"I haven't tried that yet. Could you recommend some channels?"
Clara,"Sure, I'll send you some links. Also, we could study together if you want."
Carlton,"That would be great. Thanks a lot, Clara."
Clara,"No problem, Carlton. We can get through this together."
Carlton,"I appreciate it, Clara. You're a lifesaver."
