Sure, the chat was among four friends - Jaiden, Cindy, Tre, and John, who are part of a group named 'Art Enthusiasts' on WhatsApp. The conversation started with Jaiden asking if the others tried out new painting techniques he shared the previous week. Cindy responded affirmatively, mentioning she found the wet-on-wet technique tricky but fun. Tre mentioned struggling with the dry brush technique and asked for tips. John suggested watching tutorial videos, while Cindy advised using a stiff brush and little paint. Jaiden appreciated the tips shared and proposed they continue practicing and share their works the following week. John and Tre agreed to this plan. The conversation was started by Jaiden on 12th March 2022 at 18:30.
