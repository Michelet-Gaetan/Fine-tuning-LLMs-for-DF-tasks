The conversation is among four high-school students: Jaiden, Cindy, Tre, and John. It starts with Jaiden asking about a math homework on quadratic equations. Cindy confirms and explains the topic, after which Tre expresses his confusion about the quadratic formula. John and Cindy then explain the formula and its coefficients to Tre, who appreciates their help. Jaiden then suggests they all study together for the upcoming test, to which everyone agrees. They decide to meet up in the library after school the next day for their study group.
