Sarah,Hey Geraldine, have you been keeping up with the Olympics?
Geraldine,Yes, I have Sarah! I'm really enjoying the swimming events. How about you?
Sarah,I've been glued to the athletics! The 100m sprint was incredible!
Geraldine,It was, wasn't it? I also loved the gymnastics. Simone Biles is amazing.
Sarah,She really is. Have you seen any of the football games?
Geraldine,I watched a couple. The skill level is unbelievable!
Sarah,It certainly is. I can't wait for the next Olympics.
Geraldine,Me neither! It's going to be a long wait but worth it.
