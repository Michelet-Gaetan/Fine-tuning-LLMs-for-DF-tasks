Paul;"Hey Amelia, how are you?"
Amelia;"I'm good, Paul. How about you?"
Paul;"I'm fine too. I wanted to talk about our younger siblings."
Amelia;"Sure, what about them?"
Paul;"I feel like they are growing up too fast. Don't you think?"
Amelia;"Yes, I agree. It's like just yesterday they were toddlers."
Paul;"Exactly! I mean look at Tom, he's already going to high school next year."
Amelia;"And Sally is entering middle school. Can you believe it?"
Paul;"It's crazy. We need to spend more time with them."
Amelia;"Definitely. Maybe we can plan something for the weekend?"
Paul;"That sounds great. Maybe a picnic or a movie night at home?"
Amelia;"I love that idea. Let's do it."
Paul;"Great! I'll start planning. Talk to you later, sis."
Amelia;"Talk to you later, bro."
