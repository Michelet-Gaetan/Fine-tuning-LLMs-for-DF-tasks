Amanda,Hey Paulette, do you have the notes from yesterday's Chemistry class?
Paulette,Hi Amanda! Yes, I do. Do you want me to send them over?
Amanda,Yes please, that would be great. I missed the class because of basketball practice.
Paulette,No problem, I'll send them to you shortly. How's the basketball team doing?
Amanda,We're doing good. We've been practicing for the upcoming tournament.
Paulette,That sounds exciting! I'll come and cheer for you guys.
Amanda,That'd be great, thanks! We could use all the support we can get.
Paulette,Of course, we're in this high school journey together after all. I'll send the notes now.
Amanda,Thanks, Paulette. You're a lifesaver!
Paulette,Anything for a friend. Let's ace this semester together!
