Paulette, Oh wow, I'll have to check it out then!;
Amanda, You definitely should. Do you have any show recommendations for me?;
Paulette, Hmm, have you tried watching The Queen's Gambit? It's not exactly a historical drama, but it's really entertaining.;
Amanda, No, I haven't. I'll add it to my watch list. Thanks!;
Paulette, No problem! Let me know what you think once you've watched it.;
Amanda, Sure thing. By the way, have you heard of the new movie "Tenet"?;
Paulette, Yes, I've heard of it but not watched it. Is it worth watching?;
Amanda, It's a bit complicated but if you love Nolan's movies, you'll enjoy it.;
Paulette, I do enjoy his movies. I'll give it a go then. Thanks, Amanda!;
