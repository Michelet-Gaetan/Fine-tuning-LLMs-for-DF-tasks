Falon,Hey Manuel, have you heard the new album of Coldplay?
Manuel,Hey Falon, yes I did. I think it's really good, especially the song "Coloratura".
Falon,I agree, "Coloratura" is my favorite too. I also loved their collaboration with BTS.
Manuel,Yes, that was quite unexpected. But the song "My Universe" turned out to be a great blend of two different styles.
Falon,Exactly. It's like a perfect fusion of pop and rock. What other genres do you listen to?
Manuel,I'm a big fan of jazz and blues. Recently, I've been listening to a lot of Miles Davis.
Falon,Oh, Miles Davis is a legend. I personally love "So What". It's such a classic.
Manuel,Yes, "So What" is a masterpiece. Do you play any instruments?
Falon,I'm learning to play the guitar. I hope to play like Eric Clapton one day.
Manuel,That's cool. Keep practicing and you'll get there. Speaking of Clapton, have you heard his song "Tears in Heaven"?
Falon,Yes, it's a beautiful song. It always makes me emotional.
Manuel,Same here. It's one of those songs that touches your soul.
Falon,I totally agree. Music has such a powerful impact on our emotions.
