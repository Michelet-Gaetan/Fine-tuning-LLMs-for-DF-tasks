The conversation between Falon and Manuel on Telegram, in the 'Book Club' group, started on 12.04.2021 at 10:30:00. Falon initiated the chat, asking Manuel if he had read the new book by J.K. Rowling. Manuel had not, but upon hearing Falon's strong recommendation, he showed interest in the mystery novel with magical elements. The conversation then shifted to 'To Kill a Mockingbird', a favorite for both. Falon also suggested another book, 'The Book Thief', for Manuel to read if he enjoys historical fiction.
