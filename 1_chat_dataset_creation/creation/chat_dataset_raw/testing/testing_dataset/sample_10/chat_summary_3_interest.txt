The conversation takes place between Joseph, Elizabeth, and Justin in a Telegram group chat named "Business Ventures". The chat begins on the 1st of June, 2022, at 6:30 pm. The discussion is centered around a new shipment of an unnamed product, which is implied to be of a high-quality and possibly illegal nature, given the secrecy and emphasis on safety. Joseph, who seems to be the supplier, mentions that the shipment will arrive by the following night. Elizabeth proposes a secluded and safe location for the drop-off, and Justin suggests discussing these details privately for safety reasons. Joseph agrees and promises to update the others when the shipment nears.
