Joseph;Hey guys, do you remember when we used to fight over the remote control?
Elizabeth;Oh yes, those were the days. Justin, you always wanted to watch cartoons.
Justin;And you, Liz, always wanted to watch those boring documentaries!
Joseph;And now, look at us. We all have our own TVs, but we miss those fights.
Elizabeth;Indeed, Joe. It's the fights and bickering that actually brought us closer as siblings.
Justin;True, Liz. Now, we may have our own TVs, but we've also got our own lives. I miss you guys.
Joseph;Well, we should plan a reunion soon. And this time, weâ€™ll let Justin have the remote control.
Elizabeth;Sounds like a plan, Joe! Justin, you better not make us watch cartoons all day.
Justin;Deal! But only if you promise not to make us watch any documentaries, Liz.
