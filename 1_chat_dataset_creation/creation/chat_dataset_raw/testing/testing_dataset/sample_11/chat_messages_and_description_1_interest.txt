Nicholas,"Hey Scharron, you heard about the heist going on?"
Scharron,"Yeah, Nick, crazy stuff. Seems like it's straight out of a movie."
Nicholas,"Exactly, I can't believe it's happening in real life."
Scharron,"Got any idea who's behind it?"
Nicholas,"Not a clue. But they're experts, that much is clear."
Scharron,"You're telling me! The way they bypassed the security... professionals for sure."
Nicholas,"And the way they've kept their identities hidden... impressive."
Scharron,"Yeah, and the speed of it all. It's like they've planned for years."
Nicholas,"I wonder what they'll do next."
Scharron,"Whatever it is, I hope they get caught. This isn't a movie, after all."
