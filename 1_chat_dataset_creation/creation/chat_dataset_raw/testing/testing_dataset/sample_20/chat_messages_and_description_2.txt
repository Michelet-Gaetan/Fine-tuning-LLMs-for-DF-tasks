Joshua,"Well, I've seen it and it's fantastic. You guys are in for a treat!"
Brandon,"Okay, no spoilers. But let's discuss it once everyone's seen it. It's too good!"
Marvin,"Sounds like a plan. We can have a virtual watch party over the weekend."
Kea,"Great idea, Marvin! I'll get the popcorn."
Joshua,"And I'll bring the theories! Looking forward to it."
Brandon,"Haha, Joshua, always the conspiracy theorist!"
Marvin,"That's what makes our discussions interesting. Can't wait for the weekend!"
Kea,"Same here, guys. Let's do this!"
Joshua,"It's a date then. See you all on the other side of 'Stranger Things'!"
