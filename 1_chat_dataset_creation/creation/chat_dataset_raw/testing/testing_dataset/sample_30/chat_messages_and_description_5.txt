Jayden,"Hey guys, have you read any good books recently?";
Joy,"Hey Jayden, I've been reading 'The Silent Patient'. It's a psychological thriller and it's really good!";
Kathleen,"I've been reading a lot of non-fiction. I just finished 'Educated' by Tara Westover.";
Jayden,"Oh, I've heard about 'Educated'. It's about a woman who grows up in a strict and abusive household but eventually goes to college, right?";
Kathleen,"Yes, that's the one. It's a very powerful story about the importance of education and the lengths one can go to achieve it.";
Joy,"That sounds interesting. I'll add it to my list. Jayden, any recommendations from you?";
Jayden,"Sure, if you're into fantasy, I'd recommend 'The Name of the Wind'. It's the first book in a trilogy.";
Joy,"I love fantasy! I'll definitely check it out. Kathleen, any other books you'd recommend?";
Kathleen,"If you're interested in history, 'Sapiens' is a great read. It's about the history of humankind.";
Jayden,"Sounds intriguing. I'll add it to my list. Thanks for the recommendations, guys.";
Joy,"No problem, happy reading!";
Kathleen,"Same to you both. Looking forward to our next book chat!"
