Jason,Hey everyone, have you ever thought about where you'd like to go if we planned a group trip?
Desiree,Definitely! I've always wanted to see the Northern Lights in Iceland. 
Katherine,That sounds amazing, Desiree! I'd love to go to Japan, the culture and food have always intrigued me.
Ronda,Japan sounds great, Katherine. I have always wanted to go on a safari in Kenya though.
Mario,I have a soft spot for history. So, Greece is on top of my list. 
Jason,Great choices everyone! Let's put these options into a poll and vote?
Desiree,Good idea Jason. But before that, let's discuss the best time to travel to these places.
Katherine,For Japan, it's best to go in Spring for the cherry blossoms, or in Autumn for the fall colors.
Ronda,In Kenya, the best wildlife viewing months are during the dry season from late June to October.
Mario,And for Greece, the best time is from April to early November. The weather is warm and there's little rain.
Desiree,For Iceland, the best time to see the Northern Lights is from late September to late March.
Jason,Perfect, let's put all this info into the poll too.
Katherine,Great! Looking forward to this trip, wherever we end up going!
Ronda,Same here, can't wait!
