Jason, "So, what do you guys think about existentialism?"
Desiree, "Well, I find it quite intriguing. It's all about finding self and personal meaning in life."
Katherine, "I agree with Desiree, but it also feels like a lonely philosophy. It relies so heavily on the individual."
Ronda, "But isn't that the point, Katherine? To highlight the importance of individual choice in a seemingly indifferent universe."
Mario, "I see your points, but I lean more towards Absurdism. Life is meaningless and it's up to us to create our own purpose."
Jason, "That's interesting, Mario. But doesn't that sound similar to Existentialism?"
Mario, "They're similar, but Absurdism is more about embracing the absurdity of life rather than seeking personal meaning."
Katherine, "I can see why you'd think that way, Mario. It's definitely a unique perspective."
Desiree, "Regardless of our philosophical inclinations, I think it's beautiful how we can interpret and find our own meanings in life."
Ronda, "Absolutely, Desiree. That's the beauty of philosophy, isn't it? It allows us to explore different perspectives and possibilities."
Jason, "Well said, everyone. This was a great discussion."
