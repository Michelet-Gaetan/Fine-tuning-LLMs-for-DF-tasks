In the conversation, Helen and Karen, both avid readers, are discussing the books they recently read. Karen has just finished "The Silent Patient", a psychological thriller by Alex Michaelides, and highly recommends it to Helen who enjoys books with unexpected plot twists. On the other hand, Helen is currently engrossed in "Educated", a memoir by Tara Westover, which Karen has already read and found inspiring. The conversation concludes with Karen's suggestion to form a book club to share and discuss their reads, an idea Helen readily agrees to. The chat takes place on WhatsApp in a group named "Book Lovers".
