Helen,Hey Karen, how's the college search going?
Karen,Hi Helen, it's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. There are so many options!
Helen,I know right! It's hard to decide which one is the best fit.
Karen,Exactly. I'm looking at the course offerings, faculty, location, everything.
Helen,Have you visited any campuses yet?
Karen,Not yet. I'm planning to visit a few next month.
Helen,That's a good idea. It will give you a feel of the environment.
Karen,Yeah, I hope so. I'm also trying to understand the financial aspects.
Helen,That's important too. You might want to look at scholarship options.
Karen,Definitely. I'm also looking at student loan options just in case.
Helen,Do you need any help? I can share some resources.
Karen,That would be great, Helen. I appreciate it.
Helen,No problem, Karen. We're in this together.
Karen,Thanks, Helen. I really appreciate your support.
