The conversation is between Mason, Glen, and Evelyn on a WhatsApp group chat named "Weather Discussion". It begins with Mason inquiring about the weather forecast for the upcoming day. Glen responds, stating that according to the National Weather Service, it's going to be a rainy day. Evelyn, however, had seen a different forecast on Weather.com, expecting sunny weather. This leads to a discussion about the reliability of different weather sites and the group agrees to cross-check the forecast on additional sources, such as AccuWeather and the Weather Channel. They plan to regroup in an hour to discuss their findings. The conversation started on the 15th of April, 2022 at 09:30:00.
