Mason,"Hey guys, had the strangest dream last night."
Glen,"Really? What was it about, Mason?"
Mason,"I was floating in space, surrounded by stars. It was incredibly peaceful."
Evelyn,"That's so interesting, Mason! Dreams about space often represent a desire for freedom and escape."
Glen,"I usually dream about ordinary stuff, like work or home. Not nearly as exciting."
Mason,"Glen, even ordinary dreams can have interesting interpretations."
Evelyn,"Mason's right, Glen. For example, dreaming about work often means you're dedicated and ambitious."
Glen,"That's a comforting interpretation, Evelyn! I'll think about it next time."
Mason,"Let's all share our dreams more often. It's fascinating to hear different experiences and interpretations."
Evelyn,"Agreed, Mason. It's a plan."
