Mason, "Hey guys, have you checked the weather forecast for tomorrow?";
Glen, "I just did, Mason. It says it's going to be rainy all day.";
Evelyn, "Really? I thought it was supposed to be sunny.";
Mason, "Well, different weather sites are showing different forecasts.";
Glen, "That's true. But I checked on the National Weather Service's website.";
Evelyn, "I see, I checked on Weather.com. Maybe we should look at a few more sources to be sure.";
Mason, "Good idea, Evelyn. I'll check on AccuWeather.";
Glen, "And I'll check on the Weather Channel's site.";
Evelyn, "Let's regroup in an hour with our findings.";
Mason, "Sounds like a plan. Talk to you guys in a bit.";
