Mason, "Hey guys, have you ever noticed the sibling rivalry between us?";
Glen, "Haha, definitely. Remember when we used to compete on who gets to eat the last slice of pizza?";
Evelyn, "Oh, I always won that one. Mason, you were always the peacemaker though.";
Mason, "Yeah, I guess I just hated seeing us fight. Plus, more pizza for you, Evelyn.";
Glen, "Mason, you were always the mature one. Remember when Evelyn locked herself in her room because I broke her doll by accident?";
Evelyn, "Oh, don't remind me! I was so mad at you, Glen.";
Mason, "And remember how I managed to pick the lock and get you two to make up?";
Glen, "Yeah, that was legendary. You always knew how to handle situations.";
Evelyn, "Even though we fought, I wouldn't change our childhood for anything. I love you guys.";
Mason, "We love you too, Evelyn. Sibling rivalry or not, we'll always be there for each other.";
