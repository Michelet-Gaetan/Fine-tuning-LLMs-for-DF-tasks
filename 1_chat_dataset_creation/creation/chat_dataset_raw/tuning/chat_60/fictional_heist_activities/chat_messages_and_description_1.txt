Robert,"Alright, we need a plan for the heist."
James,"I've got a blueprint of the place. It's a highly secure vault."
Robert,"Great. We need to know where the security cameras and guards are."
James,"Already on it. I've marked their locations on the blueprint."
Robert,"Perfect. Now we need a way to disable them."
James,"I've got a friend who's good with tech. He can help us."
Robert,"Get him on board. We also need a fast car for the escape."
James,"I know a guy who owns a high-speed sports car. I'll talk to him."
Robert,"We should also have a backup plan in case something goes wrong."
James,"I agree. We can have a second car ready at a different location."
Robert,"Sounds like a plan. Let's meet tomorrow to finalize everything."
James,"Alright. See you then."
