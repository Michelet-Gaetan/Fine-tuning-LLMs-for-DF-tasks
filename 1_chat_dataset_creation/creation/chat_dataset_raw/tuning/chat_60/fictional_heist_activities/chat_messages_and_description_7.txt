James,"We need a plan, gentlemen."
Robert,"Agreed, James. We need to understand the layout first."
John,"I can handle that. I have a contact who can get us the blueprints."
Michael,"Good. Timing is crucial too. We need to know when the guards change shifts."
David,"I can observe and get that information. Also, we need a getaway plan."
William,"I'll arrange the vehicles. Two cars should do it, right?"
Richard,"Yeah, that's good. But we need a backup plan as well. What if things go south?"
Joseph,"Let's hope they don't, Richard. But you're right, a backup plan is necessary."
Thomas,"We'll need a hacker too. To disable the security system."
Christopher,"I know a guy. He's the best in the business."
Mark,"Sounds like we're getting somewhere. Let's meet up and finalize the plan."
Donald,"Agreed. Tomorrow, same time?"
Robert,"Tomorrow it is then. Let's do this, gentlemen."
James,"Stay safe. See you all tomorrow."
