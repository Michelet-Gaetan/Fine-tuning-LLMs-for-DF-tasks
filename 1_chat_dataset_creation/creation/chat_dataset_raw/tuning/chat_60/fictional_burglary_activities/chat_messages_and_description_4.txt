James,"Hey Brian, I just finished reading this crime novel. The heist was amazing."
Brian,"Oh really? What was it about?"
James,"A group of thieves planned to rob a museum. The way they bypassed the security systems was ingenious."
Brian,"Sounds thrilling. What was their strategy?"
James,"They created a diversion to distract the guards, while another member slipped in through the ventilation system."
Brian,"And they managed to get away with it?"
James,"Yes, but only temporarily. Their plan was flawless, but they didn't account for the relentless detective on their trail."
Brian,"Interesting. I'll have to check out that book."
James,"Definitely. It was a great read."
