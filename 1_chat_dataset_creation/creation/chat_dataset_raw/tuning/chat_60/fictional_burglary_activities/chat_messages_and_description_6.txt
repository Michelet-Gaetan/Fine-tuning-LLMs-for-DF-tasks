James,"Hey, have you watched that movie 'The Italian Job'?"
Robert,"Yeah, why do you ask?"
James,"I was thinking, how would it be if someone actually tried to pull off something like that in reality?"
Robert,"Interesting thought, but you do realise it's a movie, right?"
James,"Of course I do. But just hypothetically, how would it go?"
Robert,"Well, first things first, they would need a well-coordinated team."
James,"Right. And each would need to have a specific set of skills."
Robert,"Exactly. Like a safecracker, tech guy, distraction team, etc."
James,"And they would need a solid plan, down to the smallest detail."
Robert,"True. And theyâ€™d need to study their target closely."
James,"Wouldn't it be easier to just hire someone to do it?"
Robert,"Maybe. But where's the fun in that? Plus, it's illegal."
James,"Fair point. It was just a thought anyway."
