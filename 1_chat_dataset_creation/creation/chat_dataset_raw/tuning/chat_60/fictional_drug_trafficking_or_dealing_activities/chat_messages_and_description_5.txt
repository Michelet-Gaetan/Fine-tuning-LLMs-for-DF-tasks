James,"Hey Richard, are you in town?"
Richard,"Yes James, just landed. What's up?"
James,"Got a new shipment. Need to move it quickly."
Richard,"Alright. What are we talking about?"
James,"Something special. Blue Sky."
Richard,"The one from the southwest?"
James,"Exactly. Got a buyer?"
Richard,"Might have. Need to check. How much are we talking about?"
James,"Enough to get us both an early retirement."
Richard,"Sounds risky, but count me in. I'll get back to you with a buyer."
James,"Good. Remember, discretion is key."
Richard,"Always has been, always will be. Talk later."
