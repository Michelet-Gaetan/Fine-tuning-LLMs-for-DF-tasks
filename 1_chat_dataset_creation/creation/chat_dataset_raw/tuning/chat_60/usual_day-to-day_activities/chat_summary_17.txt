The conversation started with John greeting everyone and asking about their sleep. Robert and Barbara reported a good night's sleep, while William had a restless night due to work-related thoughts. John and Robert advised William to learn to switch off from work, and Barbara suggested meditation. William appreciated the advice and said he would try it. John then asked everyone about their plans for the day. Robert planned to attend some work meetings and then go to the gym. Barbara planned to attend a yoga class and then go to the market. William, however, had a busy workday ahead.
