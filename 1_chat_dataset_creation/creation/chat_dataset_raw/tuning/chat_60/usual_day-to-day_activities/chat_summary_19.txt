The conversation initiated by John in the "Daily Activities" WhatsApp group involved four participants: John, David, Robert, and Michael. It started on the 22nd of September, 2022, at 8:00 AM. The discussion revolved around their day-to-day plans. 

David proposed a run followed by grocery shopping, to which Michael agreed to join for the run. Robert could not join for the run but offered to assist with the groceries. John had work in the morning but planned to join at the supermarket later. The running partners, David and Michael, agreed to meet at the park, and the group decided to meet at the supermarket at 11:30 AM.
