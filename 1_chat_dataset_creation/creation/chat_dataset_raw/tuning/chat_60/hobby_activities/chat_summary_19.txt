In the WhatsApp group chat named "Hobby Enthusiasts," which consists of David, Michael, Jennifer, and Robert, a discussion about drone photography as a hobby activity was initiated by David on 12th September 2021 at 5:45 PM. David suggested getting a drone with a high-quality camera and learning how to operate it. Jennifer revealed that she owns a drone with a good camera and agreed to use it for their hobby. The group decided to meet over the weekend to try out drone photography. They decided to meet at the park, as there would be more space to fly the drone.
