John,"Hey Robert, have you been keeping up with your painting hobby?"
Robert,"Hey John, yes I've been painting a lot recently. Just finished a landscape piece."
John,"That's cool, Robert. I'd love to see it sometime."
Robert,"Sure John, I'll bring it next time we meet. What about your guitar lessons?"
John,"They're going well, Robert. I'm learning to play 'Stairway to Heaven' now."
Robert,"That's a classic, John! Looking forward to hearing you play it."
John,"Definitely, Robert. It's a deal, your painting for my guitar performance."
