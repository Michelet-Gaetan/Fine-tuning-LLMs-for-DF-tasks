Matthew,"Hey Michael, did you catch the soccer game last night?";
Michael,"Hey Matthew, yes I did! It was an amazing game, wasn't it?";
Matthew,"Absolutely! That goal in the 90th minute was epic!";
Michael,"I know right! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.";
Matthew,"Same here! What did you think of the referee's decisions?";
Michael,"Some were spot on, but I think he missed a few fouls. What about you?";
Matthew,"I agree. Especially that one in the first half. Could have been a penalty.";
Michael,"Definitely. Well, looking forward to the next game. Should be exciting!";
Matthew,"Yes, can't wait! Let's chat again after the next game.";
