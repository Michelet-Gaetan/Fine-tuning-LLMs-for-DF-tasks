John shares that the images are quite hilarious, with the Eiffel Tower appearing to be on the verge of robbing a bank and the Statue of Liberty looking like she's about to perform surgery. Michael finds the description amusing and requests John to send him some pictures. John sends the images and Michael finds them brilliantly funny.
