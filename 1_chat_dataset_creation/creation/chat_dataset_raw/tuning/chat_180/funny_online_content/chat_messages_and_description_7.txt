"James","Hey guys, have you seen the latest cat video on YouTube?"
"Michael","Not yet, James. Is it another one of those videos with cats being scared of cucumbers?"
"Robert","Haha, I saw that one. It's super funny. The cat jumped like 3 feet in the air!"
"James","No, it's not a cucumber one. It's a cat trying to catch a laser pointer. It's hilarious!"
"Matthew","I saw that one! The cat keeps jumping and spinning around. It's so funny!"
"Elizabeth","Oh, I need to see this. I could use a good laugh."
"Michael","Here's the link: www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"

"James","Haha, good one, Michael."
"Matthew","Michael, you got us there!"
