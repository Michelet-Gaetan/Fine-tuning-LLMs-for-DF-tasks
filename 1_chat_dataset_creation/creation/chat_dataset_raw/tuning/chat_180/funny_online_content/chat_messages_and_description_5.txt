Michael,"No, I haven't. Is it the one where the cat is doing backflips?";
John,"Yes, that's the one! It's hilarious. I can't stop laughing.";
Michael,"I'll have to check it out. I could use a good laugh.";
John,"You definitely should. It's the funniest thing I've seen in a while.";
Michael,"Alright, I'm looking it up now.";
John,"Let me know what you think!";
Michael,"Oh my gosh, this is hilarious! That cat is more athletic than I am!";
John,"I know, right? I wish I could do backflips like that.";
Michael,"Same here, John. Same here.";
