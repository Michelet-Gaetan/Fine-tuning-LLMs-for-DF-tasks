The conversation between Michael, William, and Robert revolves around a fictional heist operation in progress. The chat starts with Michael confirming that they are in position. William guides them to a vault on the third floor and instructs them to bypass the security system. Robert is successful in deactivating the security system and they move towards the vault. Despite active cameras, they manage to stay undetected.

Upon reaching the vault, they encounter a biometric lock. With a device given by William, they manage to bypass the lock and gain access to the vault. They are given a 15-minute window to gather the goods and exit before the security system is reactivated. They manage to gather the goods in time and start heading towards the exit. William confirms that he will meet them at the rendezvous point.
