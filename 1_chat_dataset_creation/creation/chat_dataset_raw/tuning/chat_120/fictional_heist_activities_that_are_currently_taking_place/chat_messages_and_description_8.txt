James;I've got the blueprints for the bank. Where should I upload them?
Robert;Upload them in the secure drive. I'll check them out and plan the entry and exit points.
Elizabeth;Guys, I'm working on the alarm system. It's trickier than we thought, but I'll have it disabled.
John;Elizabeth, take your time, we can't afford any mistakes. James, once you upload the blueprint, start working on the getaway vehicles.
Michael;I've made contacts with the insiders. They're ready to help, but we need to ensure their identities remain hidden.
David;Good work, Michael. I'll ensure our tracks are covered. Let's meet at our usual spot tonight to finalize everything.
Matthew;Remember everyone, our goal isn't just the money. We're doing this to expose the corruption. Stay focused.
Jennifer;Agreed, Matthew. We're in this together. Let's make it count.
