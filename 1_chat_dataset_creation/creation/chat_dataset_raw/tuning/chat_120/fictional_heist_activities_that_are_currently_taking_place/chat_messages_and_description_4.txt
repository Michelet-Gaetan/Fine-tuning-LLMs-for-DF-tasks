John;We've got our eyes on the prize, are you in?
Robert;You know I can't resist a good heist. What's the plan?
John;We hit the Museum of Fine Arts, midnight. The new exhibit worth millions.
Robert;Security?
John;Top-notch, but I've got a guy. He'll disable the system for a 10-minute window.
Robert;That's tight. We need a backup plan.
John;We have one. If things go south, we have a getaway car at the back entrance.
Robert;Driver?
John;Betty. Best in the business.
Robert;Sounds solid. Let's do it.
John;Great. We meet tomorrow to go over the details. No slip-ups, Robert.
Robert;Don't worry, John. I've got this.
