James;I've found a potential target, the museum at the city center.
Robert;Interesting. What's the prize?
James;A priceless diamond. Guarded heavily though.
Robert;We'll need a solid plan then.
James;Exactly. We can't afford any mistakes.
Robert;What's the layout of the building?
James;I've got the blueprints. I'll send them over.
Robert;Okay. Let's figure out the best entry and exit points.
James;Already on it. We need to consider the security as well.
Robert;Right. We need to disable them without raising any suspicion.
James;We'll also need a team. I'm thinking a hacker, a con artist, and a safe cracker.
Robert;I know just the right people. Let's meet up and discuss in detail.
James;Sounds good. I'll arrange for a secure location.
Robert;See you then. We've got a diamond to steal.
