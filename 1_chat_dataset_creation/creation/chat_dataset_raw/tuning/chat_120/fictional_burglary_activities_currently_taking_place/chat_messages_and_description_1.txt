Michael;Hey Richard, there's been a new development in our fiction.
Richard;Really, Michael? What's up?
Michael;I've stumbled across a mansion. Seems like it's ripe for a fictional burglary activity.
Richard;Interesting. Who lives there in our story?
Michael;An old billionaire, Thomas. He's got a huge art collection.
Richard;Intriguing. What's our plan then?
Michael;I was thinking we could create a character who's an expert at bypassing security systems.
Richard;Sounds good. Let's also add a master locksmith to our crew.
Michael;Perfect, Richard. We could also use someone who's good with escape routes.
Richard;Agreed. Maybe someone who knows the city like the back of his hand.
Michael;Let's discuss this further tomorrow. I've got a few more ideas.
Richard;Sounds like a plan, Michael. I'll brainstorm some ideas too.
