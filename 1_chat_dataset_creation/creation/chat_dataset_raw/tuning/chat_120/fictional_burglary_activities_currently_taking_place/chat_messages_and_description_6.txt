Robert,Hey James, you heard about the break-ins happening in the neighborhood?
James,Yeah Robert, it's been all over the news. Seems like it's happening more frequently.
Robert,Exactly, it's getting pretty concerning. Do you think it's someone we know?
James,Hard to say, Robert. But it does seem to be someone who knows the area well.
Robert,Agreed. Let's keep an eye out for any suspicious activities.
James,Definitely. We should also remind our neighbors to be vigilant.
Robert,Good idea, James. Let's do that tomorrow during the community meet-up.
James,That's a plan. We need to ensure everyone's safety.
