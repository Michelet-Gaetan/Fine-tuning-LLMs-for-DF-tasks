John,"Hey, have you heard about the recent break-ins?"
Robert,"Yes, I heard about it on the news. They say it's a series of burglaries."
John,"Any idea who's behind it?"
Robert,"No, but the word is it's a professional job. They're in and out without a trace."
John,"Sounds scary. We should be careful."
Robert,"Definitely. I've already updated my security system."
John,"Good idea. I think I'll do the same."
Robert,"Better safe than sorry, right?"
John,"Absolutely. Especially these days."
Robert,"Yes, it's a crazy world out there."
John,"Stay safe, man."
Robert,"You too, John."
