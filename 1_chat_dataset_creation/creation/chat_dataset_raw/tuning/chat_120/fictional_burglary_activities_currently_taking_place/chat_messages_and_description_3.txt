James,Hey, have you heard about the recent break-ins?
Robert,Yeah, it's quite disturbing. Seems like it's happening all around town.
James,I heard they're targeting houses that seem unoccupied.
Robert,That's what I heard too. Apparently, they're quite skilled.
James,Do you think it could be someone local?
Robert,It's hard to say. But the way they're navigating the city, it could be.
James,Yeah, they would need to know the area well.
Robert,Exactly. And they're avoiding main streets, only targeting houses in secluded areas.
James,It's really scary. We need to be extra vigilant.
Robert,Agreed. We should also inform others in our neighborhood about this.
James,That's a good idea. Let's discuss this in our neighborhood meeting.
Robert,Yeah, let's do that. Safety should be our top priority.
James,Do you think we should involve the police?
Robert,Definitely. We can't handle this on our own.
James,Alright. Let's gather more info and then we'll report it to the police.
