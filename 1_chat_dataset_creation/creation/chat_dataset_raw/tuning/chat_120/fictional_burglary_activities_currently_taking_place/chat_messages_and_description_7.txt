Robert,"Hey guys, I've found something interesting."
Anthony,"What is it, Robert?"
Robert,"There's been a series of fictional burglaries in town."
David,"Fictional? You mean like in a book or movie?"
Robert,"Exactly. It's like someone's reenacting scenes from famous crime novels."
Anthony,"That's bizarre. Any idea who's behind it?"
Robert,"No clue yet. I thought we could look into it."
David,"Sounds like a plan. Count me in."
Anthony,"Me too. Let's solve this mystery."
Robert,"Great. Let's meet up tomorrow to discuss our plan of action.";
