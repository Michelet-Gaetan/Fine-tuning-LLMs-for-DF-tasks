Michael;Hey Richard, got a minute?
Richard;Sure, what's up Michael?
Michael;Been hearing about this new product in town. Ever heard of it?
Richard;Depends, what's it called?
Michael;They're calling it the 'Blue Sky'. I hear it's quite potent.
Richard;Interesting, we might want to look into it.
Michael;That's what I was thinking. We should be ahead of the game.
Richard;Let's be careful though. We don't want any heat from the authorities.
Michael;Agreed. We'll tread lightly.
Richard;I'll start gathering some intel.
