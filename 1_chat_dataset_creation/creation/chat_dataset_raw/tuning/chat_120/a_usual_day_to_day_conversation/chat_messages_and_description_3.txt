John;Good Morning, Robert. How are you today?
Robert;Good Morning, John. I'm doing well, thanks. Just getting ready for work. How about you?
John;Same here. Got a big meeting today.
Robert;Oh, really? What's it about?
John;It's about the new project we're launching soon. A bit nervous, to be honest.
Robert;You'll do great, John. You always do.
John;Thanks, Robert. I appreciate your support.
Robert;No problem, John. We're a team, after all. Let me know how it goes.
John;Will do. Have a good day at work, Robert.
Robert;You too, John. Good luck with your meeting.
