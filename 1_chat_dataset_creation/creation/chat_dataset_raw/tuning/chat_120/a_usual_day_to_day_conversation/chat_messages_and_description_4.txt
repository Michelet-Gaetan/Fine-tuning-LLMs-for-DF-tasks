James;Good morning, Robert! How are you today?
Robert;Hey James! I'm good, just got up. What about you?
James;I'm doing well, thanks. Just having my morning coffee.
Robert;That sounds great. What's the plan for the day?
James;Just the usual. Going to work, maybe hit the gym later. You?
Robert;Same here. But I think I'll skip the gym today.
James;Well, it's important to take rest days too. Have a good day, Robert!
Robert;You too, James! Catch up later.
James;Sure thing, Robert. Have a nice day.
