James;Hey everyone, I just got a new drone for aerial photography.
Robert;That sounds awesome James! What type of drone did you get?
James;I bought a DJI Mavic Pro. It's compact and has a great camera.
Elizabeth;I've been considering getting into drone photography. How difficult is it to learn?
James;It's not too difficult Elizabeth. I could give you some tips if you're interested.
Robert;I would love to see some of the photos you've taken James.
James;Sure Robert, I'll share some in the group later today.
Elizabeth;I'd appreciate that James. I might get a drone myself after seeing those photos.
Robert;It's a great hobby to get into. I've been doing it for a few years now.
James;I agree Robert. It's also a great way to see the world from a different perspective.
Elizabeth;Sounds exciting. I can't wait to see your photos James.
