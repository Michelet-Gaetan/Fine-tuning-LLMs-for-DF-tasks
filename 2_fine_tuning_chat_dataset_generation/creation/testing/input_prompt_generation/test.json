I loved the battle scenes!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:07 - Richard: I agree, Peter. The special effects were top notch!\r\n01.09.2021 13:20:55 - Karen: I haven't seen it yet!

A great psychological thriller!\r\n01.09.2021 16:26:20 - Richard: I'm currently reading 'Educated' by Tara Westover. It's an amazing memoir.\r\n01.09.2021 16:27:34 - Karen: I recently read 'Becoming' by Michelle Obama. It was truly inspiring.\r\n01.09.2021 16:28:47 - Ashley: I've just started 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. It's been on my list for a while now.\r\n01.09.2021 16:29:54 - John: 'The Silent Patient' sounds interesting, Peter. What's it about?\r\n01.09.2021 16:31:52 - Peter: It's about a woman who becomes a mute after allegedly killing her husband, and her therapist's efforts to unravel the mystery.\r\n01.09.2021 16:33:23 - Richard: I've heard good things about 'Where the Crawdads Sing', Ashley. Let us know how it is.\r\n01.09.2021 16:35:20 - Karen: I also want to read 'Educated'. Richard, maybe we can discuss it when you're done?\r\n01.09.2021 16:36:15 - Ashley: Definitely, Richard. And 'Becoming' is next on my list, Karen!\r\n01.09.2021 19:30:00 - John: Hey guys, I think we have a situation.\r\n01.09.2021 19:31:21 - Peter: What's up, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:00 - John: I believe we have a mole in our operations.\r\n01.09.2021 19:32:58 - Richard: How can you be so sure, John?\r\n01.09.2021 19:33:58 - John: Some of our shipments have been intercepted recently. This can't be a coincidence.\r\n01.09.2021 19:35:06 - Peter: We need to figure this out before things get out of hand.\r\n01.09.2021 19:36:14 - Karen: I agree with Peter. We should investigate this matter.\r\n01.09.2021 19:37:37 - Ashley: I have a few contacts who might be able to help us.\r\n01.09.2021 19:38:48 - Richard: Let's proceed with that then, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:39:18 - John: We should also be careful about what we discuss here.\r\n01.09.2021 19:40:59 - Peter: Agreed. Let's use code words for sensitive topics from now on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:42:44 - Karen: Good idea, Peter. Let's keep this under wraps until we figure out what's going on.\r\n01.09.2021 19:44:44 - Ashley: I'll start reaching out to my contacts.\r\n01.09.2021 19:45:35 - John: Keep us posted, Ashley.\r\n01.09.2021 19:46:17 - Richard: Let's tread carefully, everyone.\r\n01.09.2021 23:45:05 - John: Hey guys, have you all registered for next semester?\r\n01.09.2021 23:46:37 - Peter: I have. I'm taking 3 computer science courses.\r\n01.09.2021 23:47:59 - Richard: I'm still deciding between two philosophy courses. \r\n01.09.2021 23:49:47 - Karen: I've registered, but I'm still on the waitlist for one of my classes.\r\n01.09.2021 23:51:16 - Ashley: I haven't yet. I've been so busy with exams.\r\n01.09.2021 23:52:34 - John: Ashley, you should do it soon. The classes get filled up pretty quickly.\r\n01.09.2021 23:53:54 - Peter: Yeah, Ashley. Plus you can always change later if you need to.\r\n01.09.2021 23:55:30 - Richard: That's true. I did that last semester.\r\n01.09.2021 23:56:03 - Karen: Same here. It's better to secure your spot first.\r\n01.09.2021 23:57:11 - Ashley: You guys are right. I'll do it tonight. Thanks.\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:23 - John: Hi everyone, I was thinking about Plato's theory of forms today. What does everyone think about it?\r\n02.09.2021 05:10:59 - Peter: I've always found it fascinating. The idea that the physical world isn't the 'real' world is a mind-bending concept.\r\n02.09.2021 05:11:34 - Richard: It's an interesting theory for sure, but I've always preferred Aristotle's more tangible, empirical approach.\r\n02.09.2021 05:12:29 - Karen: I think both have their merits. Plato's idealism is a good counterpoint to Aristotle's materialism.\r\n02.09.2021 05:13:24 - Ashley: I agree with Karen. Both theories offer different perspectives on the nature of reality. They can coexist.\r\n02.09.2021 07:15:45 - John: Hey guys, remember our high school years?\r\n02.09.2021 07:16:28 - Peter: Of course, John. Those were some of the best years of my life.\r\n02.09.2021 07:17:41 - Richard: I agree. I miss the football games and the pep rallies.\r\n02.09.2021 07:18:36 - Karen: And the school plays! We had so much fun in drama club.\r\n02.09.2021 07:19:24 - Ashley: I remember the science fairs. We always had a blast creating those projects.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:06 - John: Yeah, I think we all learned a lot during those years.\r\n02.09.2021 07:20:45 - Peter: Definitely. It's amazing how much we've all grown since then.\r\n02.09.2021 07:21:32 - Richard: I'd love to go back and relive some of those moments.\r\n02.09.2021 07:23:12 - Karen: Maybe we could organize a reunion?\r\n02.09.2021 07:24:16 - Ashley: That's a great idea, Karen.

But, I have a contact who can help us disable it.\r\n15.10.2022 18:50:09 - Carlton: Sounds promising. What about the guards and surveillance cameras?\r\n15.10.2022 18:51:53 - Clara: There are four guards on rotation and cameras at every corner.

I've been busy with work. Is it any good?\r\n15.10.2022 21:15:15 - Clara: I think it's amazing! The plot seems more intense this time. You should really start watching it.\r\n15.10.2022 21:16:04 - Carlton: I've heard mixed reviews about it. Some say it's not as good as the previous seasons.\r\n15.10.2022 21:17:57 - Clara: Well, I think it's subjective. I personally loved it. There are some unexpected twists that make it more interesting.\r\n15.10.2022 21:19:46 - Carlton: Alright, you've convinced me. I'll start watching it this weekend.\r\n15.10.2022 21:20:35 - Clara: Great! We can discuss the episodes once you've seen them.\r\n15.10.2022 21:22:35 - Carlton: Sounds good.

But we also need to consider the budget.\r\n20.09.2022 16:36:37 - Robert: How about backpacking across Europe? It's affordable and we can explore different cultures.\r\n20.09.2022 16:37:54 - Reba: I love the idea, Robert! We could start from Spain and make our way to Greece.\r\n20.09.2022 16:39:13 - Nadir: Sounds like a plan! We should make a list of must-visit places and things to do.\r\n20.09.2022 16:40:53 - Ronnie: Absolutely, Nadir. Also, we need to check the best time to visit these countries.\r\n20.09.2022 16:42:48 - Sheree: Yes, and let's not forget about food. We must try local cuisines in each country.\r\n20.09.2022 16:44:24 - Robert: Agreed, Sheree. I can't wait to try some authentic pizza in Italy.\r\n20.09.2022 16:45:46 - Reba: Sounds like we have a plan, guys. Let's start preparing for our European adventure.\r\n20.09.2022 18:30:00 - Reba: Alright team, we have a new job. The target is the National Museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:31:29 - Nadir: Sounds risky, Reba. What's the prize?\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:28 - Reba: A priceless artifact, The Heart of the Ocean. It's worth the risk.\r\n20.09.2022 18:33:58 - Ronnie: I'm in. I can handle the security systems.\r\n20.09.2022 18:35:48 - Sheree: I'll get us the blueprints of the museum.\r\n20.09.2022 18:37:15 - Robert: And I can arrange our getaway vehicle.\r\n20.09.2022 18:38:21 - Reba: Excellent. Everyone knows their role. Let's meet at the usual spot tomorrow to iron out the details.\r\n20.09.2022 18:39:48 - Nadir: I've got a feeling this is going to be a big one.\r\n20.09.2022 18:40:54 - Ronnie: Just another day at the office, Nadir.\r\n20.09.2022 18:41:48 - Sheree: Blueprints are in hand.

Enjoy your movie night, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 05:32:44 - Amanda: Hi Paulette, have you ever pondered about the concept of existence? What it truly means to exist?\r\n26.08.2024 05:34:36 - Paulette: Hello Amanda, that's a deep question. I think existence is subjective. It's different for every individual based on their perception.\r\n26.08.2024 05:35:15 - Amanda: That's an interesting viewpoint. What about the idea of reality? Do you think our reality is constructed by our minds or is it an independent entity?\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:13 - Paulette: I lean towards the concept of constructed reality. Our experiences and perceptions shape our reality.\r\n26.08.2024 05:36:59 - Amanda: So, would you say our thoughts and consciousness shape the reality around us?\r\n26.08.2024 05:38:20 - Paulette: Yes, I believe so. But at the same time, I think there are certain objective truths or realities that exist beyond our perceptions.\r\n26.08.2024 05:39:54 - Amanda: It's fascinating to think about, isn't it? How our minds can potentially shape the world around us.\r\n26.08.2024 05:41:00 - Paulette: Definitely, it's an intriguing subject. Philosophy really makes you question the world and your place in it.\r\n26.08.2024 11:07:10 - Amanda: Hey Paulette, have you tried that new Italian restaurant downtown?\r\n26.08.2024 11:09:07 - Paulette: Hi Amanda, are you talking about Bella Napoli?\r\n26.08.2024 11:10:16 - Amanda: Yes, that's the one! I heard it's really good.\r\n26.08.2024 11:11:02 - Paulette: I've been there once. The pasta was amazing!\r\n26.08.2024 11:12:03 - Amanda: Really? What else did you try?\r\n26.08.2024 11:13:45 - Paulette: I also had the tiramisu. It was absolutely delicious.\r\n26.08.2024 11:14:49 - Amanda: That sounds great. I'm thinking of going there this weekend.\r\n26.08.2024 11:15:27 - Paulette: You should! And make sure to try their seafood risotto. It's their specialty.\r\n26.08.2024 11:17:22 - Amanda: Seafood risotto, got it. Thanks for the recommendation, Paulette!\r\n26.08.2024 11:18:50 - Paulette: You're welcome, Amanda.

Is it worth a watch?\r\n26.08.2024 15:25:10 - Amanda: Absolutely! The storyline is so intriguing.\r\n26.08.2024 15:27:05 - Paulette: I'll add that to my list too then. Thanks for the recommendations, Amanda.\r\n26.08.2024 15:27:55 - Amanda: You're welcome, Paulette! Enjoy your TV time.\r\n26.08.2024 15:29:51 - Paulette: Definitely will. Talk to you later, Amanda.",

It's quite a fascinating experience.\r\n27.08.2024 10:04:19 - Nicholas: Really? Can you control what happens in those dreams?\r\n27.08.2024 10:05:36 - Scharron: To some extent, yes. But it takes practice and not all dreams are lucid.\r\n27.08.2024 10:07:15 - Nicholas: I see. I want to learn how to have lucid dreams. Any advice?\r\n27.08.2024 10:08:25 - Scharron: Well, it involves recognizing that you're dreaming while you're in the dream. A trick is to look for details that don't make sense in real life.\r\n27.08.2024 10:09:20 - Nicholas: That sounds challenging but fun. I'll give it a try.\r\n27.08.2024 10:10:30 - Scharron: Good luck, Nicholas! Remember, it might take time. Don't get frustrated.\r\n27.08.2024 10:11:15 - Nicholas: Thanks for the advice, Scharron.

The eldest just started middle school.\r\n27.08.2024 13:39:15 - Nicholas: Wow, time flies. How are they coping with the new environment?\r\n27.08.2024 13:40:02 - Scharron: They're adjusting well. It's a bit challenging but they're managing.\r\n27.08.2024 13:41:56 - Nicholas: That's good to hear. And how's your husband?\r\n27.08.2024 13:43:23 - Scharron: He's doing well. Busy with work as always.\r\n27.08.2024 13:45:12 - Nicholas: Send my regards to him. We should plan a family get together soon.\r\n27.08.2024 13:46:47 - Scharron: That sounds like a great idea.

How about you?\r\n27.08.2024 19:16:46 - Nicholas: I'm thinking about going hiking, the weather should be good.\r\n27.08.2024 19:18:12 - Scharron: That sounds fun, where are you planning to go?\r\n27.08.2024 19:19:59 - Nicholas: Probably the local national park, wanna join?\r\n27.08.2024 19:20:32 - Scharron: I'd love to, but I am not feeling too adventurous lately.\r\n27.08.2024 19:21:04 - Nicholas: No problem, maybe next time. We could do a movie night instead?\r\n27.08.2024 19:21:47 - Scharron: Sure, that sounds great. Any movie suggestions?\r\n27.08.2024 19:22:59 - Nicholas: How about 'The Shawshank Redemption'? It's a classic.\r\n27.08.2024 19:23:36 - Scharron: Oh, I love that movie. It's a deal then.\r\n27.08.2024 19:24:35 - Nicholas: Great, see you on Saturday then.\r\n27.08.2024 19:25:28 - Scharron: Looking forward to it, see you!",

I think we have the power to make our own choices, independent of any predetermined path.\r\nAliyah: I think it's a mix of both.

It suggests that free will is compatible with determinism.\r\nAlex: That's a fascinating perspective, Chester. Can we dive deeper into compatibilism?\r\nSydney: Sure, we can look at it in terms of cause and effect.

I believe in determinism. Every action we take is a result of some previous action or event.\r\n05.08.2022 18:30:07 - Salik: Interesting Sydney, but I lean more towards free will. I think we have the power to make our own choices, independent of any predetermined path.\r\n05.08.2022 18:31:37 - Aliyah: I think it's a mix of both. Our surroundings and upbringing might shape us, but we still have the power to make decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:32:11 - Chester: Both views have merit, but I'm intrigued by the notion of compatibilism, which combines free will and determinism.

Can we dive deeper into compatibilism?\r\n05.08.2022 18:34:44 - Sydney: Sure, we can look at it in terms of cause and effect. Compatibilism suggests that our actions are both caused by previous events and also by our decisions.\r\n05.08.2022 18:36:34 - Salik: So, in essence, it's like saying although our choices are influenced, they're still our choices. That's a thought-provoking take.\r\n05.08.2022 18:38:18 - Aliyah: I like the idea of compatibilism. It seems to provide a balance between free will and determinism.\r\n05.08.2022 18:40:00 - Chester: Exactly, Aliyah. It's all about finding that balance.

Can we review it tomorrow?\r\n16.12.2021 01:06:13 - Brent: Sure, we can go over it before class. I also had a hard time with it.\r\n16.12.2021 01:07:40 - Mae: Thanks, Brent. Also, have you decided on a topic for the History project?\r\n16.12.2021 01:08:45 - Brent: Not yet, any suggestions?\r\n16.12.2021 01:10:08 - Mae: What about the French Revolution? I think we can find a lot of resources on it.\r\n16.12.2021 01:11:32 - Brent: Sounds good to me. Let\u2019s start researching tomorrow after we review the math homework.\r\n16.12.2021 01:13:13 - Mae: Perfect! See you tomorrow, Brent.\r\n16.12.2021 01:14:22 - Brent: See you, Mae.\r\n16.12.2021 04:38:00 - Mae: Hey Brent! I had the weirdest dream last night.\r\n16.12.2021 04:38:32 - Brent: Really? What happened?\r\n16.12.2021 04:39:37 - Mae: I was flying over a city full of skyscrapers, it was so real.\r\n16.12.2021 04:41:16 - Brent: That's cool! Do you often have dreams where you're flying?\r\n16.12.2021 04:43:16 - Mae: Not really, it's the first time. Do you believe dreams have meanings?\r\n16.12.2021 04:44:33 - Brent: Well, I think they can be influenced by our thoughts and experiences. For example, if you've been thinking about freedom or escape, that might explain the flying.\r\n16.12.2021 04:45:38 - Mae: That makes sense. I've been feeling quite stressed at work lately. Maybe I'm yearning for an escape.\r\n16.12.2021 04:46:51 - Brent: It's possible. Dreams can be a way for our subconscious to communicate with us.\r\n16.12.2021 04:47:58 - Mae: Do you remember your dreams often?\r\n16.12.2021 04:49:01 - Brent: Not always. But there are some dreams that I remember vividly, like the one where I was chased by a giant cookie.\r\n16.12.2021 04:50:00 - Mae: Ha! That sounds like a fun dream, unless you're scared of cookies.\r\n16.12.2021 04:51:24 - Brent: It was more amusing than scary. Anyway, it's interesting to analyze dreams, isn't it?\r\n16.12.2021 04:53:05 - Mae: Definitely! It gives us a glimpse into our subconscious mind.\r\n16.12.2021 04:54:02 - Brent: Yeah, I agree. Let's share more dreams next time.\r\n16.12.2021 04:56:00 - Mae: Sure thing, Brent. Goodnight for now.\r\n16.12.2021 10:26:36 - Mae: Hey Brent, have you seen the line-up for the upcoming music concert?\r\n16.12.2021 10:28:16 - Brent: Not yet, Mae. Which bands are playing?\r\n16.12.2021 10:29:49 - Mae: The headliners are Arctic Monkeys and The Black Keys. They also have some emerging local bands.\r\n16.12.2021 10:31:06 - Brent: That sounds amazing! I'm a big fan of Arctic Monkeys. When is it happening?\r\n16.12.2021 10:32:14 - Mae: It's on the 25th of next month. I was thinking of buying the tickets.\r\n16.12.2021 10:32:48 - Brent: Count me in, Mae. Let's do it! I can't miss this concert.\r\n16.12.2021 10:34:42 - Mae: Great! I'll get the tickets and let you know the details.",

I thought it was pretty good.\r\n12.04.2022 14:08:02 - David: To each their own, I guess.\r\n12.04.2022 15:59:32 - David: Hey Thomas, I've recently started listening to classical music and I'm loving it\r\n12.04.2022 16:00:42 - Thomas: That's awesome, David! Do you have any favorite composers or pieces yet?\r\n12.04.2022 16:01:12 - David: I've mainly been listening to Beethoven. His Moonlight Sonata is simply beautiful\r\n12.04.2022 16:02:20 - Thomas: I completely agree. Beethoven's work is timeless. I'd also recommend Mozart if you're looking to explore more\r\n12.04.2022 16:04:05 - David: Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check out some of Mozart's works. Do you play any instruments?\r\n12.04.2022 16:05:31 - Thomas: I used to play the piano when I was younger. Nowadays, I just enjoy listening to good music\r\n12.04.2022 16:06:54 - David: That's cool! I've been thinking about learning the guitar. Any tips?\r\n12.04.2022 16:07:26 - Thomas: That's a great choice! Just be patient with yourself and practice regularly. It'll come to you eventually\r\n12.04.2022 16:09:11 - David: Thanks for the advice, Thomas. I'll keep that in mind. \r\n12.04.2022 17:08:22 - David: Hey Thomas, how are you doing?\r\n12.04.2022 17:10:17 - Thomas: Hey David, I am good! How about you?\r\n12.04.2022 17:11:48 - David: I am doing well, thanks. I've been thinking about dreams lately.\r\n12.04.2022 17:12:48 - Thomas: Oh really? That's interesting. In what way?\r\n12.04.2022 17:13:49 - David: I was just wondering if there is a specific reason we dream about certain things.\r\n12.04.2022 17:14:47 - Thomas: I think dreams are a reflection of our subconscious mind. They can be influenced by our day-to-day experiences, thoughts, and feelings.\r\n12.04.2022 17:16:28 - David: Interesting. Have you ever had a recurring dream?\r\n12.04.2022 17:17:18 - Thomas: Yes, I have. It was a strange one where I was flying above a city. \r\n12.04.2022 17:18:03 - David: That sounds fascinating. Do you think it had any specific meaning?\r\n12.04.2022 17:18:48 - Thomas: It's hard to say for sure. But I think it might have represented a desire for freedom and exploration.\r\n12.04.2022 17:20:03 - David: That's a great interpretation. It's amazing how our minds work, isn't it?\r\n12.04.2022 17:21:37 - Thomas: It sure is, David. The human mind is truly fascinating.\r\n12.04.2022 22:33:42 - David: Hey Thomas, how's the weather looking on your end?\r\n12.04.2022 22:35:12 - Thomas: Hi David, it's quite sunny here. How about at your place?\r\n12.04.2022 22:35:50 - David: It's quite gloomy here. Looks like it's going to rain.\r\n12.04.2022 22:37:50 - Thomas: Oh, that's quite the contrast. Make sure to carry an umbrella if you're heading out.\r\n12.04.2022 22:39:46 - David: Will do, Thomas. Hopefully, it clears up soon.\r\n12.04.2022 22:41:29 - Thomas: Fingers crossed, David. Stay safe out there.\r\n12.04.2022 22:43:01 - David: Thanks, Thomas. You too, enjoy the sun.",

It's not the what, it's the how. We should revisit our process\r\n24.08.2021 14:35:11 - Parker: That's a good point, Kim. We need to ensure we're not cutting corners\r\n24.08.2021 14:36:09 - April: We also need to think about security.

Any plans for Sunday?\r\n31.07.2022 21:12:34 - Manuel: Yes, I plan to visit a museum. Do you have any recommendations?\r\n31.07.2022 21:13:41 - Falon: You should check out the art museum downtown. They have a new exhibition.\r\n31.07.2022 21:15:07 - Manuel: That sounds interesting. Will definitely check it out. Thanks, Falon!\r\n31.07.2022 21:17:03 - Falon: No problem! Enjoy your visit. Let's catch up next week.\r\n31.07.2022 21:18:15 - Manuel: Sure, sounds like a plan.

I think it's really good, especially the song \"Coloratura\".\r\n31.07.2022 23:20:56 - Falon: I agree, \"Coloratura\" is my favorite too. I also loved their collaboration with BTS.\r\n31.07.2022 23:21:56 - Manuel: Yes, that was quite unexpected. But the song \"My Universe\" turned out to be a great blend of two different styles.\r\n31.07.2022 23:23:39 - Falon: Exactly. It's like a perfect fusion of pop and rock. What other genres do you listen to?\r\n31.07.2022 23:24:23 - Manuel: I'm a big fan of jazz and blues. Recently, I've been listening to a lot of Miles Davis.\r\n31.07.2022 23:26:09 - Falon: Oh, Miles Davis is a legend. I personally love \"So What\". It's such a classic.\r\n31.07.2022 23:26:52 - Manuel: Yes, \"So What\" is a masterpiece. Do you play any instruments?\r\n31.07.2022 23:28:06 - Falon: I'm learning to play the guitar. I hope to play like Eric Clapton one day.\r\n31.07.2022 23:28:51 - Manuel: That's cool. Keep practicing and you'll get there. Speaking of Clapton, have you heard his song \"Tears in Heaven\"?\r\n31.07.2022 23:30:40 - Falon: Yes, it's a beautiful song. It always makes me emotional.\r\n31.07.2022 23:31:42 - Manuel: Same here. It's one of those songs that touches your soul.\r\n31.07.2022 23:32:17 - Falon: I totally agree.

I can't wait for the next episode. Do you have any other series to recommend?\r\n01.08.2022 03:01:00 - Manuel: Yes, I just started watching 'Stranger Things'. It's really good so far.\r\n01.08.2022 03:02:04 - Falon: I've heard a lot about it. What's it about?\r\n01.08.2022 03:03:14 - Manuel: It's a sci-fi horror series. It's about a group of kids in a small town who encounter supernatural phenomena.\r\n01.08.2022 03:04:02 - Falon: Sounds intriguing! I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the suggestion!\r\n01.08.2022 03:05:29 - Manuel: No problem! Let me know what you think about it.\r\n01.08.2022 03:07:06 - Falon: Sure, I will.

But doesn't that undermine the notion of moral responsibility? If our actions are predetermined, can we be held accountable for them?\r\nRebecca: I think that's where compatibilism comes in. It's the idea that free will and determinism can coexist. We can make choices, but those choices are influenced by a variety of factors.\r\nEvelyn: Yes, Rebecca. Compatibilism is a compelling perspective. It allows for complexity in our understanding of free will and determinism.\r\nKenneth: I agree. It's a complex issue with no clear-cut answers. It's always fascinating to delve into these philosophical discussions.\r\nRebecca: Absolutely, Kenneth.

The images it's sending back are simply amazing.\r\n05.04.2022 11:56:34 - Kenneth: It's like we're on the brink of some revolutionary discoveries.\r\n05.04.2022 11:57:13 - Rebecca: I wonder what implications this could have for future space travel.\r\n05.04.2022 11:58:58 - Evelyn: Definitely. But I also hope we don't forget about taking care of our own planet while we're exploring others.\r\n05.04.2022 12:00:40 - Kenneth: That's a good point, Evelyn. It's all a matter of balance.\r\n05.04.2022 12:02:02 - Rebecca: Well said, both of you. I think this is a conversation that needs to be had on a larger scale.\r\n05.04.2022 12:03:35 - Evelyn: Agree. It's a topic that combines science, ethics, environmentalism... so complex.\r\n05.04.2022 12:05:10 - Kenneth: Let's all keep ourselves updated on this. It's interesting to see where it goes.\r\n05.04.2022 15:19:39 - Kenneth: Good morning, Rebecca and Evelyn\r\n05.04.2022 15:20:14 - Rebecca: Morning Kenneth, how's the project going?\r\n05.04.2022 15:22:08 - Kenneth: It's on track, but we're facing some minor issues with the software\r\n05.04.2022 15:22:41 - Evelyn: I've noticed that too, Kenneth. It's been quite slow lately\r\n05.04.2022 15:24:18 - Rebecca: Should we report this to IT?\r\n05.04.2022 15:25:37 - Kenneth: Yes, please do. In the meantime, let's try to make do with what we have\r\n05.04.2022 15:26:35 - Evelyn: Agreed. I'll also make a list of all the issues we've been having\r\n05.04.2022 15:27:13 - Rebecca: Sounds like a plan. Let's also schedule a meeting to discuss this\r\n05.04.2022 15:28:36 - Kenneth: Good idea, Rebecca. Let's meet at 2pm\r\n05.04.2022 15:29:59 - Evelyn: Works for me. Looking forward to resolving these issues\r\n05.04.2022 15:30:58 - Rebecca: Same here. See you both at 2pm\r\n05.04.2022 15:32:48 - Kenneth: See you then. Have a productive morning\r\n05.04.2022 21:12:00 - Kenneth: Hi guys, have you watched the latest episode of 'The Crown' yet?\r\n05.04.2022 21:12:45 - Rebecca: Hey Kenneth, yeah I have. I think the character development this season is really interesting!\r\n05.04.2022 21:13:31 - Evelyn: I haven't seen it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n05.04.2022 21:15:29 - Kenneth: Sure thing, Evelyn. But you should catch up soon. It's getting really good.\r\n05.04.2022 21:16:22 - Rebecca: Definitely! And once you're done, Evelyn, we should all discuss it!\r\n05.04.2022 21:17:35 - Evelyn: Sounds like a plan. I'll try to watch it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:01 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you checked out the new podcast by Malcolm Gladwell?\r\n06.04.2022 02:04:41 - Rebecca: Hi Kenneth, not yet. What's it about?\r\n06.04.2022 02:06:11 - Kenneth: It's called \"Revisionist History\". It's about events in the past that have been misunderstood or overlooked. It's quite interesting.\r\n06.04.2022 02:07:47 - Evelyn: Oh, that sounds like something I would enjoy. I love history.\r\n06.04.2022 02:08:43 - Kenneth: You should definitely check it out then, Evelyn. And you too, Rebecca. I think you'll both like it.\r\n06.04.2022 02:10:39 - Rebecca: I'll certainly give it a listen. Thanks for the recommendation, Kenneth!\r\n06.04.2022 02:11:31 - Evelyn: Adding it to my list now. Thanks, Kenneth!\r\n06.04.2022 02:13:04 - Kenneth: You're welcome! Let me know what you think once you've listened to it.\r\n06.04.2022 02:14:32 - Rebecca: Will do!\r\n06.04.2022 02:16:13 - Evelyn: Same here!\r\n06.04.2022 07:28:43 - Kenneth: Hey guys, have you seen the latest episode of 'The Crown' on Netflix?\r\n06.04.2022 07:30:11 - Rebecca: Hi Kenneth, yes I watched it last night. So much drama! Evelyn, have you seen it yet?\r\n06.04.2022 07:31:58 - Evelyn: I haven't gotten around to it yet. No spoilers, please!\r\n06.04.2022 07:32:36 - Kenneth: No worries, Evelyn. We'll keep it spoiler-free. But you definitely need to catch up soon!\r\n06.04.2022 07:34:05 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Evelyn. The performances this season are top-notch. They've really outdone themselves.\r\n06.04.2022 07:35:07 - Evelyn: Sounds exciting! I'll make sure to start watching it this weekend.\r\n06.04.2022 07:36:26 - Kenneth: Great! We can discuss it more once you've seen it. In other news, have you guys heard about the new Star Wars series in development?\r\n06.04.2022 07:38:12 - Rebecca: Yes, I read about it. It's supposed to be set in a completely different timeline, right?\r\n06.04.2022 07:39:56 - Evelyn: That's right. I'm really looking forward to seeing a new side of the Star Wars universe.\r\n06.04.2022 07:41:48 - Kenneth: Me too, it's about time they explored other aspects. I'm quite excited about it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:42:27 - Rebecca: I'm cautiously optimistic. Let's hope they do a good job with it.\r\n06.04.2022 07:43:09 - Evelyn: Agreed. But for now, I'm off to start 'The Crown'. Talk to you guys later!\r\n06.04.2022 11:59:15 - Kenneth: Hello Rebecca and Evelyn, I've been thinking about the concept of free will lately. Do you think our choices are truly ours, or are they predetermined by factors beyond our control?\r\n06.04.2022 12:00:26 - Rebecca: I think it's a mix of both, Kenneth. Some choices are influenced by our surroundings, but we also have the ability to make conscious decisions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:02:11 - Evelyn: Interesting perspective, Rebecca. I often lean more towards determinism though. I believe that every event, including human cognition and behavior, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences.\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:05 - Kenneth: That's a valid point, Evelyn. But doesn't that undermine the notion of moral responsibility? If our actions are predetermined, can we be held accountable for them?\r\n06.04.2022 12:04:44 - Rebecca: I think that's where compatibilism comes in. It's the idea that free will and determinism can coexist. We can make choices, but those choices are influenced by a variety of factors.\r\n06.04.2022 12:06:31 - Evelyn: Yes, Rebecca. Compatibilism is a compelling perspective. It allows for complexity in our understanding of free will and determinism.\r\n06.04.2022 12:07:13 - Kenneth: I agree. It's a complex issue with no clear-cut answers. It's always fascinating to delve into these philosophical discussions.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:00 - Rebecca: Absolutely, Kenneth. These discussions always leave me with more questions than answers, but I suppose that's the beauty of philosophy.\r\n06.04.2022 12:09:42 - Evelyn: Well said, Rebecca. It's the pursuit of wisdom and understanding that makes philosophy so captivating.",

Did you enjoy it?\r\n09.09.2021 00:14:59 - Rylan: Yes, it was a great read. I think you'll enjoy it too.\r\n09.09.2021 00:16:12 - Phyllis: Great, I'll move it up on my reading list.

How about you?\r\n09.09.2021 06:03:45 - Rylan: I'm good, thanks. I was just watching the basketball game.

It's a classic rivalry.\r\n09.09.2021 06:07:27 - Phyllis: That sounds exciting! Who's leading?\r\n09.09.2021 06:08:44 - Rylan: The Lakers are up by 3 points right now, but there's still plenty of time left.\r\n09.09.2021 06:09:42 - Phyllis: I'm rooting for the Celtics. They have a great team this season.\r\n09.09.2021 06:10:35 - Rylan: They do indeed. But I'm a Lakers fan, so we're on opposite sides for this one!\r\n09.09.2021 06:11:57 - Phyllis: May the best team win then!\r\n09.09.2021 11:08:37 - Rylan: Hey Phyllis, did you catch the latest episode of The Crown?\r\n09.09.2021 11:10:29 - Phyllis: Hi Rylan, yes I did!

He's phenomenal!\r\n09.09.2021 11:15:31 - Phyllis: Yes, his performance is quite captivating. I'm also really enjoying Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret.\r\n09.09.2021 11:17:17 - Rylan: She's always been one of my favorite actresses. Her versatility is just amazing.\r\n09.09.2021 11:18:05 - Phyllis: Indeed. Can't wait for the next episode!\r\n09.09.2021 11:19:30 - Rylan: Me too.

It's quite an intriguing concept. It's the idea that individuals are free and responsible for their own choices and actions, right?\r\n14.10.2021 21:54:50 - Willie: Exactly, Mary. It emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and subjectivity.\r\n14.10.2021 21:55:34 - Mary: But don't you think it can lead to a sense of isolation or despair, considering the emphasis on individual freedom and the lack of external forces?\r\n14.10.2021 21:56:22 - Willie: That's a valid point, Mary. However, it also gives the individual the freedom to define their own purpose in life.\r\n14.10.2021 21:57:28 - Mary: True, Willie. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. A balance between individual freedom and understanding the consequences of our choices.\r\n14.10.2021 21:59:05 - Willie: Well said, Mary. I think that's the crux of existentialism - understanding that freedom comes with responsibility.\r\n14.10.2021 22:00:48 - Mary: Indeed, Willie.
