Fine-tuning-LLMs-for-DF-tasks
=============================

This GitHub repository contains the different python scripts that were using for the experiments described in our paper: [Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Digital Forensics: Case Study and General Recommendations](https://github.com/Michelet-Gaetan/Fine-tuning-LLMs-for-DF-tasks). Most of the provided scripts are written in python and the rest is written in bash.

You will also find some of the datasets used during the experiments. Some of them were modified versions of [SAMSUM](https://metatext.io/datasets/samsum) and can therefore not be shared. You will find the shareable datasets on this [HuggingFace dataset page](https://huggingface.co/GaetanMichelet/datasets). Regarding the fine.tuned models created, you can access them on this [HuggingFace dataset page](https://huggingface.co/GaetanMichelet/models)

This repository is divided into 5 different parts of the experiment that took place chronologically. If you'd like to replicate the experiment you should follow the different steps in order.

Should you detect an anomaly on this repo or have any question, do not hesitate to contact us.
